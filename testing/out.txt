EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF 
  THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE 
  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL 
Seventy-first Meeting 
Montreal, 2-6 December 2013 
 
 
 
 
REPORT OF THE SEVENTY-FIRST MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
Introduction 
1. 
The 71st meeting of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of 
the Montreal Protocol was held at the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization, 
Montreal, Canada, from 2 to 6 December 2013. 
2. 
The meeting was attended by representatives of the following countries, members of the 
Executive Committee in accordance with decision XXIV/22 of the Twenty-Fourth Meeting of the Parties 
to the Montreal Protocol: 
(a) 
Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol: Belgium, Canada,

AGENDA ITEM 1:  OPENING OF THE MEETING 
7. 
The meeting was opened by the Chair, Ms. Fiona Walters, who welcomed members and 
congratulated the new Executive Secretary of the Ozone Secretariat, Ms. Tina Birmpili, and the new 
Chief Officer of the Multilateral Fund Secretariat, Mr. Eduardo Ganem, on their appointments. The Chair 
went on to outline the heavy agenda for what would be the last meeting of 2013, the HCFC production 
and consumption freeze year for Article 5 countries. In 2014, the Executive Committee would be holding 
two meetings a year, which meant that business planning for the 2014-2016 period would be addressed at 
the present meeting rather than at the first meeting of 2014. According to the business plans submitted by 
the agencies, activities for the 2012-2014 triennium had been under-programmed by US $21 million, with 
over-programming of activities for the years 2015 to 2020. The Chair further pointed out that the report 
on balances and availability of resources showed that there were insufficient funds available for approval 
of all activities being considered at the 71st meeting, information that would be updated later in the 
meeting by the Treasurer. 
8. 
Other items to be examined by the Executive Committee included: performance indicators for 
implementing agencies, progress reports on various activities, status reports and compliance, as well as 
delays in the completion of CFC, CTC and halon projects approved since 2009, including the request that 
any unused balances be returned to the Multilateral Fund in 2014. No new HCFC phase-out management 
plans (HPMPs) were being proposed, but some obstacles to the introduction of low 
global-warming-potential (GWP) technologies in Article 5 countries, particularly in the refrigeration and 
air conditioning sector, required discussion. UNEP’s Compliance Assistance Programme (CAP) budget, 
and the administrative cost regime for the upcoming triennium were further issues for the Executive 
Committee’s consideration. 
9. 
The Executive Committee meeting’s agenda also featured three policy issues related to HCFC 
phase-out: continuing discussion on the guidelines for preparatory funding for stage II of HPMPs; key 
considerations to minimize adverse climate impact in the servicing sector as applicable to HCFC 
phase-out; and the criteria for funding HCFC phase-out in the consumption sector adopted by 
decision 60/44. The discussion on the review of the funding criteria had been deferred to the 72nd meeting, 
but information regarding the incremental capital costs and operating costs incurred under stage I of 
HPMPs would be presented to the meeting by the Secretariat in accordance with decision 70/21. 
10. 
Following her opening remarks, the Chair explained that the TEAP Replenishment Task Force 
co-chairs, Mr. Lambert Kuijpers and Ms. Shiqiu Zhang, were present at the meeting to consult with 
members regarding the 2015-2017 replenishment, pursuant to decision XXV/8 of the Twenty-fifth 
Meeting of the Parties, which requested the TEAP to consult widely on the matter with all relevant 
persons and institutions. 
11. 
Following the opening remarks of the Chair, the Executive Committee congratulated 
Ms. Tina Birmpili on her appointment as Executive Secretary of the Ozone Secretariat; they looked 
forward to working with her.

AGENDA ITEM 3:  SECRETARIAT ACTIVITIES 
15. 
The Chief Officer began by extending the congratulations of the Fund Secretariat to 
Ms. Tina Birmpili, the new Executive Secretary of the Ozone Secretariat; he stressed his intention to 
preserve the historical cooperation and collaboration between the two Secretariats. 
16. 
He then introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/2, which provided an overview of the 
work done by the Secretariat since the 70th meeting, drawing attention to the summaries of the various 
meetings attended and missions undertaken by the staff of the Secretariat and the interaction with other 
international organizations.  
17. 
He informed the Executive Committee that, while attending the Twenty-Fifth Meeting of the 
Parties, he had held informal discussions with a representative of the Secretariat of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on ways in which the two Secretariats could 
collaborate. He had also provided a briefing on the Multilateral Fund, its modalities, and the current 
HCFC phase-out activities approved by the Executive Committee to two representatives of the European 
Parliament. 
18. 
Since being appointed, the Chief Officer had also made two courtesy visits in response to 
invitations from the Secretary General of ICAO and the Executive Secretary of the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (SCBD). He had also received representatives of the Diplomatic Corps Services of 
the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, Canada, at the offices of the Fund 
Secretariat. 
19. 
In addition, although the Secretariat had received invitations to attend other events, it had been 
unable to attend owing to preparations for the present meeting. These included the signature of the 
Minamata Convention, meetings of the Board of the Green Climate Fund, the GEF Council meeting, and 
the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. He said that he would welcome guidance from Committee 
members on how to handle such invitations. In response, one member said that he hoped that the Chief 
Officer and the Secretariat would continue to be judicious in considering such invitations. Another 
member said that it was useful, when possible, for a representative of the Secretariat to attend other 
meetings to share lessons learned and to absorb the lessons learned by others. In that respect, several 
members considered contact with the Green Climate Fund an interesting proposition, although the 
primary function of the Secretariat should remain to serve the Executive Committee and the Multilateral 
Fund. One member suggested that, in future reports on its activities, the Secretariat could include an 
additional section summarizing the advice given by the Secretariat to other bodies and organizations to 
keep track of it and to help ensure consistency. 
20. 
The Chief Officer informed the Committee that the Secretariat provided a comprehensive review 
of the HPMP for Azerbaijan at the request of the GEF Secretariat.  Several members expressed their 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
6 
support for the role played by the Secretariat in the review of GEF projects as it had specific expertise of 
value to the process.  
21. 
In response to questions on human resources issues, the Chief Officer said that the Executive 
Committee would need to approve the budget, taking into account the reclassification of two posts from 
general service (GS) staff level to professional staff (P) level that had occurred during the reclassification 
exercise within the two UNEP offices in Montreal undertaken by the Human Resources Management 
Service of the United Nations Office at Nairobi (UNON). Providing an update on progress made in filling 
vacant posts within the Secretariat, he explained that, since assuming his new role, he had primarily 
concentrated on preparations for the present meeting. However, the process of filling the vacant posts was 
under way and the related job descriptions were being submitted to UNEP. 
22. 
One representative recalled that, at previous meetings, the Committee had identified a need for 
clear directives to build bridges between the Multilateral Fund and other multilateral environmental 
agreements (MEAs). Bridges were indeed being built as evidenced by the participation of Executive 
Committee members in a special working group at the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. The 
Multilateral Fund had valuable experience to share with the UNFCCC in its efforts to develop its own 
financial mechanism. 
23. 
Following the discussion, the Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note with appreciation the report on Secretariat activities contained in document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/2; and 
(b) 
To request the Secretariat to incorporate into future reports on Secretariat activities an 
additional section summarizing the advice given by the Secretariat to other bodies and 
organizations to enable monitoring and to ensure consistency. 
(Decision 71/1) 
AGENDA ITEM 4:  STATUS OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND DISBURSEMENTS 
24. 
The Treasurer introduced the report on the status of contributions and disbursements 
(UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/3) and provided updated information on countries’ contributions to the Fund 
as at 29 November 2013. He said that additional cash contributions had been received from the 
Government of Andorra (US $11,944) and the Government of the United States of America 
(US $1.5 million) as well as  the proceeds of the United States of America’s promissory notes due in 2013 
(US $1.67 million). He reported that the Fund’s balance stood at US $86.2 million, 62.8 per cent of 
pledges had been paid, and the balance on the gain from the fixed-exchange-rate-mechanism stood at 
US $20.6 million. The Fund’s balance was composed of US $59.9 million in cash and US $26.3 million 
in promissory notes. He also said that the Ozone Secretariat had explained to the Permanent Observer of 
the Holy See to UNEP and UN-HABITAT that all non-Article 5 Parties had to make financial 
contributions to the Fund. The Permanent Observer of the Holy See had promised to advise the Holy See 
accordingly. It was suggested that the Fund Secretariat and the Treasurer be requested to continue 
discussing the matter with the Holy See. 
25. 
In response to a question on accrued interest earned, the Treasurer said that all accrued interest 
from all implementing agencies up to September 2013 had been reported.  In response to a question on 
the outstanding contribution by the Russian Federation, the representative of the Secretariat explained 
that, while the Russian Federation had agreed to pay its contributions starting in 2013 and had paid its 
contribution for 2013, there had been no agreement on payment of its outstanding contributions. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
7 
26. 
Later during the meeting the Treasurer reported that an additional US $23 million had been 
received from the Government of the United States of America and, consequently, the Funds’ balance 
stood at approximately US $109.2 million, composed of approximately US $83.0 million in cash and 
US $26.2 million in promissory notes, and the report of the Treasurer would be updated accordingly. 
27. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the report of the Treasurer on the status of contributions and disbursements and 
the information on promissory notes, as contained in Annex I to the present report;  
(b) 
To further note that the interest reported in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/3 
excluded the interest of US $94,385 earned on balances transferred from the 
implementing agencies to the Government of China; 
(c) 
To urge all parties to pay their contributions to the Multilateral Fund in full and as early 
as possible; and 
(d) 
To request the Treasurer, in consultation with the Fund Secretariat, to continue the 
discussions with the Holy See on its outstanding contributions to the Multilateral Fund 
and to report back to the Executive Committee at its 72nd meeting. 
(Decision 71/2) 
AGENDA ITEM 5: STATUS OF RESOURCES AND PLANNING 
(a) 
Report on balances and availability of resources 
28. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/4 and said 
that, taking into account the Fund’s balance as reported by the Treasurer, which included the return of the 
unused balance of the Secretariat’s 2012 budget and the amounts returned by the implementing agencies 
from completed and ongoing projects, the total level of resources available at the present meeting stood at 
US $90,465,533 and that consequently there could be a shortfall of US $11,523,033 if the Executive 
Committee approved all the projects under consideration at the present meeting.  
29. 
In the discussion that followed, the Executive Committee was informed that the balances for two 
completed projects would be returned to the Fund by the Government of France.  It was pointed out that it 
was premature to conclude that there might be a shortfall in funding required at the present meeting as it 
might be the case that additional funds would be received or that not all the projects being considered 
would be approved. It might be useful to encourage implementing agencies to return the balances for 
projects completed over two years previously to the 72nd meeting instead of simply asking them to do so 
as soon as possible. 
30. 
In response to a question on past practice with regard to shortfalls in funding, the representative 
of the Secretariat confirmed that they had occurred in the past and that the way to address the issue would 
be for the Fund Secretariat to meet with the implementing agencies to agree on the process for the transfer 
of funds as soon as they became available. In some cases, funds were deposited between meetings. She 
also explained that, while the Secretariat was actively encouraging the implementing agencies to return 
funds as soon as possible, the agencies had administrative constraints related to financial closure of 
completed projects.  
31. 
As indicated in paragraph 26 above, the Treasurer had reported at a later stage during the meeting 
that an additional US $23 million had been received from the Government of the United States of 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
8 
America.  Consequently, sufficient funding would be available for the amounts recommended for 
approval at the present meeting and no further consultation was required on the matter.  
32. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The report on balances and availability of resources contained in document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/4; 
(ii) 
That the net level of funds being returned by the implementing agencies at the 
71st meeting was US $3,918,245 against projects, which included the return of 
US $28,343 from UNDP, US $583,568 from UNEP, US $48,717 from UNIDO 
and US $3,257,617 from the World Bank; 
(iii) 
That the net level of support costs being returned by the implementing agencies 
at the 71st meeting was US $318,818 against projects, which included the return 
of US $2,380 from UNDP, US $53,981 from UNEP, US $3,655 from UNIDO 
and US $258,802 from the World Bank; 
(iv) 
That implementing agencies had balances totalling US $566,914, excluding 
support costs, from projects completed over two years previously, which 
included US $94,141 for UNDP, US $273,027 for UNEP and US $199,746 for 
UNIDO; 
(v) 
That UNDP had already alerted its country offices to financially close those 
projects with balances completed over two years previously;  
(vi) 
That UNEP would return funds for 16 of 21 projects not related to HCFCs or 
methyl bromide (MB) at the 72nd meeting;  
(vii) 
That UNIDO would return balances by the 72nd meeting for three projects: China 
(CPR/PRO/47/INV/436), Pakistan (PAK/REF/59/PRP/74) and Saudi Arabia 
(SAU/FOA/60/PRP/07);  
(viii) 
That the Government of Japan had balances totalling US $335, excluding support 
costs, for one project completed over two years previously;  
(ix) 
That the Government of France’s balances for two projects completed over two 
years previously and not yet returned to the Fund, totalling US $308,920, 
excluding support costs, would be returned to the Fund;  
(x) 
That the net level of funds and support costs being returned by the bilateral 
agencies at the 71st meeting was US $6,444, which included the return of 
US $3,260 from the Government of the Czech Republic, US $2,992 from the 
Government of Japan, and US $192 from the Government of Portugal; and to 
request the Treasurer to follow up with the respective Governments on the cash 
transfer to the Fund; and 
(b) 
To request: 
(i) 
Implementing agencies with projects completed over two years previously to 
return the balances at the 72nd meeting, or as soon as possible thereafter; and 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
9 
(ii) 
UNEP to return at the 72nd meeting all unobligated balances identified in 
document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/4. 
(Decision 71/3) 
(b) 
2013-2015 business plans and tranche submission delays 
33. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/5, and 
informed the members of the Committee that UNDP had withdrawn the submission for the third tranche 
of the HPMP for the Islamic Republic of Iran subsequent to issuance of the document. 
34. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The report on the 2013-2015 business plans and tranche submission delays as 
contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/5;  
(ii) 
The information on tranche submission delays under multi-year agreements 
(MYAs) submitted to the Secretariat by UNDP, UNEP, UNIDO and the World 
Bank; 
(iii) 
That 49 out of 66 tranches of MYAs due for submission had been submitted on 
time to the 71st meeting and that five of them had been withdrawn after 
discussion with the Fund Secretariat;  
(iv) 
With concern, that the political situation in the Central African Republic might 
have a negative impact on compliance with the control measures of the Montreal 
Protocol; 
(v) 
That the other tranches not submitted to the 71st meeting as listed in Table 7 of 
document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/5 were not expected to have a negative 
impact on compliance owing to the fact that the latest consumption figures were 
below the baseline or import controls in place would ensure compliance; 
(b) 
To request:  
(i) 
The bilateral and implementing agencies to address those activities not submitted 
in 2013 as planned, as contained in Annex II to the present report, in their 
2014-2016 business plans;  
(ii) 
The Secretariat: 
a. 
To send letters to the Governments of the following countries to urge the 
submission of the next tranche of the MYA, indicating where applicable 
that the 71st meeting was the second meeting to which the tranche could 
have been submitted but had not been: Angola, Bangladesh, Brazil, 
Burundi, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iraq, 
Jordan, Peru, and Suriname (for submission to the 72nd meeting), and 
Qatar and Thailand (for submission to the 73rd meeting), noting the 
reasons 
for 
delays 
indicated 
in 
Table 
7 
of 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/5;    
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
10 
b. 
To send letters to the Governments of Cuba, the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia, and Saudi Arabia to urge the submission of the next tranches of 
their MYAs to the 72nd meeting, noting that the tranches had been 
withdrawn from consideration at the 71st meeting after discussion with the 
Fund Secretariat owing to the countries’ inability to meet the 20 per cent 
disbursement threshold for funding and/or insufficient progress in 
implementation; 
c. 
To send a letter to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
revise the third tranche of stage I of the HCFC phase-out management 
plan (HPMP) and to submit it to the 72nd meeting, noting that the tranche 
had been withdrawn from consideration at the 71st meeting after issuance

(Decision 71/6) 
Methyl bromide project in Guatemala 
40. 
Following the introduction of the project by the representative of the Secretariat, several members 
expressed their regret at the Government of Guatemala’s inability to meet its MB phase-out commitments 
in 2012, in accordance with its Agreement with the Executive Committee, while noting its willingness to 
return the associated funds and acknowledging its revised commitment to phase out MB consumption 
completely by 1 January 2015. In response to a request for more details on how the Government of 
Guatemala proposed to implement the project without those funds, the representative of UNIDO 
explained that some equipment had already been delivered, and that users which had exceeded their 
maximum allowable level would be required to contribute to the installation of that equipment so that 
compliance could be achieved by 1 January 2015. It was suggested that an operational licensing system 
was a hurdle to be addressed in order to achieve phase-out, but it was also pointed out that using the new 
technology was also a major challenge; the issue was far more complex and must go beyond the question 
of licensing if sustainable alternatives were to be introduced. 
41. 
In response to an additional query, the representative of UNIDO said that he could not confirm 
that consumption for 2013 and 2014 would be within the limit allowed under the Agreement, but that the 
aim was to ensure that from 1 January 2015 onwards, no MB would be imported into the country. 
42. 
After informal discussions in the margins of the meeting, the Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The progress report on the implementation of the methyl bromide (MB) 
phase-out project in Guatemala submitted by UNIDO on behalf of the 
Government 
of 
Guatemala, 
contained 
in 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/6/Add.1;  
(ii) 
With concern the deviation of the MB consumption from the 2012 target 
established in the agreed conditions for the phase-out of MB in Guatemala and 
the potential deviation in consumption for the years 2013 and 2014; 
(iii) 
That the Government of Guatemala agreed to return US $265,300 to the 
Multilateral Fund from the funds approved in accordance with the agreed 
conditions made at the 59th meeting, consisting of US $210,000, plus agency 
support costs of US $15,750 for UNIDO, and US $35,000, plus agency support 
costs of US $4,550 for UNEP, by the 72nd meeting;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
13 
(iv) 
That the Government of Guatemala had established an enforceable licensing 
system allowing for the control of all ozone-depleting substances, including 
controlled uses of MB, and had committed to phasing out all controlled uses of 
MB completely by 1 January 2015 instead of 1 January 2013; and 
(b) 
To request UNIDO and UNEP to submit: 
(i) 
A progress report to the 73rd meeting on the ban on the import of controlled uses 
of MB as of 1 January 2015 and the actions undertaken to ascertain the long-term 
sustainability of the alternative technologies; and 
(ii) 
The project completion report no later than the last meeting of the Executive 
Committee in 2015. 
(Decision 71/7)

43. 
Following the introduction by the representative of the Secretariat, the Executive Committee 
decided: 
(a) 
To note the progress report submitted by UNEP for the national CFC phase-out plan 
(NPP) work plan for the Philippines covering the period April 2012-October 2013 
contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/6/Add.1; and 
(b) 
To request UNEP to submit to the 72nd meeting a financial report on the NPP as of 
31 December 2013 and to return the remaining funds to the Multilateral Fund at that 
meeting. 
(Decision 71/8) 
CTC phase-out in process agent applications (phase II) in China 
44. 
A representative of the Secretariat reported that the phase-out targets contained in the process 
agent sector plan had been achieved and that the sector plan had been operationally completed. She 
indicated that the Government of China had put in place a licensing system, a quota system and an ODS 
production and consumption monitoring mechanism to enable it to sustain CTC phase-out in future years.  
45. 
Appreciation was expressed of the persistence shown by the Government of China and the World 
Bank in implementation of the process agent sector plan.  
46. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To 
note 
the 
verification 
report

Progress report on the implementation of chiller projects 
47. 
The representative of the Secretariat drew members’ attention to the related amendments 
contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/6/Add.1/Corr.1.  
48. 
In the course of a discussion on the lack of information on energy efficiency, it was emphasized 
that energy efficiency information was fundamental and the implementing agencies should be collecting it 
and including it in their project completion reports, together with information on choice of technology. 
49. 
In response to a request for clarification on the disproportionately high cost of individual chillers 
in Brazil and Colombia, the representative of UNDP indicated that in Brazil the chillers were just one 
component of a large project related to energy efficiency that had major counterpart funding from various 
national and international sources, whilst in Colombia, two chillers had been replaced by a district cooling 
system that could not be directly compared to the replaced chillers.   
50. 
The representative of the World Bank, responding to a question regarding GEF’s refusal to 
approve co-funding for Indonesia’s part of a global chiller replacement project, said that after some nine 
months of discussion aimed at finding flexibility and common ground, GEF had indicated in a letter that 
it had decided not to endorse the project based on a Council member’s objection to the technology likely 
to be used.  
51. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the report on chiller projects submitted by UNDP, UNIDO and the World Bank 
contained in documents UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/6/Add.1 and Corr.1; 
(b) 
To request UNIDO:

(Decision 71/10) 
Delays in the completion of CFC, CTC and halon projects  
52. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced the report on the completion of the ongoing CFC, 
CTC and halon projects approved after 2009. Following a review of information provided by the 
implementing agencies regarding the ongoing projects, the agencies had been asked to provide reasons 
why the projects should be extended beyond their planned completion dates (the latest such date being 
2013 for 59 of the 64 ongoing projects). The implementing agencies had proposed changes to the 
completion dates for some projects, providing reasons with which the Secretariat agreed, as reflected in 
the Secretariat’s recommendations to the Executive Committee. 
53. 
Following the presentation, the Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note the report on the completion of CFC, CTC and halon projects approved after 
2009 and beyond as contained in documents UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/6/Add.1 
and Corr.1;

as at the planned completion date, and that UNEP return any unused balances from this 
project as soon as possible but no later than twelve months after the date of completion. 
(Decision 71/11) 
Financial audit report from China on the CFC production, halon and CTC sector plans 
54. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced the issues linked to the financial audit report from 
China on the CFC production, halon and CTC sector plans. The balance of funds disbursed by the World 
Bank but held by China was US $28,297,298 at the end of 2012, even though budgets for the remaining 
balances had been approved 4.5 years previously. The audit report from China also indicated that interest 
of US $1,978,838 had been generated as at the end of 2012. That amount should be offset against future 
approvals and reported in the Accounts of the Fund in line with decision 70/20 (c) and (d). 
55. 
Following the presentation, the World Bank sought clarification on the Secretariat’s 
recommendations to the Executive Committee and explained that the World Bank might have difficulty 
complying with certain requests therein as it was not the sole agency implementing all the sector plans in 
China, and because some of the requests involved obtaining information from the country before 
reviewing it and submitting it to the Executive Committee.  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
17 
56. 
Some members felt that the Secretariat should engage in bilateral discussions with the 
Government of China and the World Bank to ensure that the wording of the decision reflected the aim of 
the proposed decision, namely, to obtain relevant information on financial disbursements, balances and 
offsetting balances from the various sector plans for future approvals in China.  After hearing a report on 
the work of the drafting group, members felt that a contact group should address the work of the drafting 
group. 
57. 
Following a report of the contact group, the Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the financial audit report submitted by the Government of China through the 
World 
Bank 
pursuant 
to 
decision 
56/13 
contained 
in 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/6/Add.1; 
(b) 
To invite the Government of China to provide: 
(i) 
Through the World Bank, a report to the 72nd meeting explaining why the 2012 
audit report indicated balances higher than the budgets approved at the 56th and 
57th meetings for the halon and polyurethane foam sectors, and information on 
the resolution of the legal issue identified in the verification report to the 
65th meeting with respect to the transportation of recovered halons to halon banks 
for recovery and recycling requested by decision 65/10(i)(ii); 
(ii) 
Through the relevant implementing agency, in future financial audit reports per 
decision 56/13, data on all funds from the Multilateral Fund that were being held 
by the Government of China for disbursement to final beneficiaries, and the 
interest accrued from those balances held by the Government of China, including 
data on the process agent II sector plan, the solvent sector plan and the 
refrigeration servicing plan;  
(iii) 
Comprehensive information on progress related to the work plans for the sector 
plans and its proposal on how to use potential balances for the consideration of 
the Executive Committee at the 72nd meeting; and 
(c) 
To request the Secretariat to prepare a document for submission to the 72nd meeting, 
including all relevant information to allow the Executive Committee to continue 
considering China’s plans to use the balances held for all sector plans. 
(Decision 71/12) 
Resource mobilization for climate co-benefits 
58. 
The representative of the Secretariat presented the findings of two reports prepared by UNDP and 
the World Bank on the results of resource mobilization activities undertaken with funds approved at the 
63rd meeting.  
59. 
Following the introduction, a number of members highlighted the lessons that could be drawn 
from the resource mobilization examples given in the reports, pointing to the benefits for both ODS 
phase-out and increased energy efficiency. Further discussion of the matter would be welcome, as would 
further results from other demonstration projects. In response to questions from members of the Executive 
Committee, the representatives of UNDP and the World Bank explained that they applied the lessons 
learned from the process of resource mobilization to subsequent projects. The Green Development 
Initiative was also mentioned as a promising source of ideas for resource mobilization. The possibility of 
leveraging significant funds through well executed resource mobilization was highlighted as a matter that 
merited closer attention.

(Decision 71/17) 
AGENDA ITEM 6: 2014-2016 BUSINESS PLANS 
(a) 
Consolidated business plan of the Multilateral Fund 
67. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/7, 
addressing some of the issues raised therein. 
68. 
Updating the Committee on the issue of possible overlaps in business plans for projects 
implemented by more than one agency, he said that following the decision by the Government of Italy to 
withdraw the activities in the refrigeration servicing sector in the HPMP for Bosnia and Herzegovina 
from its business plan, there was no longer an issue. 
69. 
In the ensuing discussion, several members said that they could support the recommendations 
made by the Secretariat on the basis that approval of the business plan did not denote approval of the 
activities therein or of the associated levels of funding. A number of concerns were nonetheless raised, 
particularly with regard to the over-programming, especially the high level of funding associated with 
stage II of HPMPs and the production sector, as well as the overlap between stage I and stage II in 2016 
for the production sector. Some members said that they required more information on certain of the 
proposals for activities not required for compliance before being in a position to decide whether to 
remove them from the business plan or to maintain them. One member suggested further discussion on 
how to prioritize such projects. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
20 
70. 
In response to the recommendation that future business plans include a distribution of tonnage for 
HPMPs according to the cost-effectiveness of the overall HPMP agreement, the representative of the 
Secretariat explained that in certain business plans there had been monetary values without a 
corresponding phase-out tonnage, which had led to the calculation of cost-effectiveness being infinity. 
This distorted the overall figures of tonnage associated with HPMPs implemented under the Multilateral 
Fund. 
71. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note the consolidated 2014-2016 business plan of the Multilateral Fund contained in 
document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/7; 
(b) 
To add to the 2014 business plans those multi-year agreement and institutional 
strengthening activities from the 2013 business plans that had not been submitted or not 
approved at the 71stmeeting; 
(c) 
To remove activities in the refrigeration servicing sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 
Italy’s business plan;  
(d) 
To request bilateral and implementing agencies: 
(i) 
To submit stage I HCFC phase-out management plan (HPMP) activities for 
Botswana not included in the business plans; 
(ii) 
In future business plans:  
a. 
To provide a distribution of tonnage for HPMPs according to the 
cost-effectiveness of the overall HPMP agreement; 
b. 
To indicate project funding requirements based on the estimated tonnage 
required to achieve the next scheduled reduction; 
c. 
To indicate those countries for which business plan entries represented a 
100 per cent phase-out in accordance with decision 62/10; and 
(e) 
To endorse the consolidated 2014-2016 business plan of the Multilateral Fund, as 
adjusted by the Secretariat and the Executive Committee, while noting that endorsement 
denoted neither approval of the projects identified therein nor their funding or tonnage 
levels. 
(Decision 71/18) 
(b) 
Business plans of the bilateral and implementing agencies 
(i) 
Bilateral agencies 
72. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/8, 
explaining that three bilateral agencies (Germany, Italy and Japan) had submitted business plans in 
tabular form. Although France had not submitted a business plan, the document included a table showing 
the allocation of resources for France based on MYA activities associated with HPMPs approved in 
principle. He informed the Committee that, after the Secretariat's adjustments, the activities in Germany's 
bilateral business plan for 2014, plus the approvals to date, were less than 20 per cent of the country's 
contribution to the Fund.  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
21 
73. 
The Executive Committee decided to take note of the 2014-2016 business plans of bilateral 
agencies submitted by Germany, Italy and Japan, as addressed in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/8. 
(Decision 71/19) 
(ii) 
UNDP 
74. 
The representative of UNDP introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/9. 
75. 
With regard to the proposal to reinstate in the business plan an activity to map ODS alternatives, 
some members thought that the exercise would provide useful information to help countries with stage II 
of their HPMPs; others suggested that it should already be undertaken as part of the agencies’ preparation 
of stage II of the HPMPs and was, therefore, a duplication. One member was not in favour of the project 
because it was not needed for compliance; another suggested that the Committee discuss how activities 
not required for compliance should be dealt with in the future. 
76. 
Although the countries that would be involved in the project were deemed by members to be 
fairly representative of the broad range of situations faced by Article 5 countries, the representative of 
UNDP explained that the countries had not been chosen on that basis. They were simply those that had 
shown interest in the exercise. Additional countries could still be included. This sparked discussion of the 
need to ensure regional balance in order to capture the specificities of the various geographical conditions 
and of the number of countries that should be involved. One member said that, if a large number of 
countries were to take part, then the matter might be better addressed during the discussions on the draft 
guidelines for funding the preparation of stage II of HPMPs under Agenda item 9. Another member said 
that he was in favour of the project as long as it also dealt with not-in-kind alternatives.  
77. 
The representative of UNDP said that the project would be particularly useful as it would involve 
consideration of a broad range of enterprises, including non-eligible and multinational companies, not just 
those receiving funds from the Multilateral Fund. 
78. 
Following an informal discussion on the issues among interested Committee members, during 
which there was no consensus on reinstating the ODS mapping activity in the business plan, the 
Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note the 2014-2016 business plan of UNDP contained in document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/9; 
(b) 
To urge UNDP to submit the HCFC phase-out management plan for Mauritania as soon 
as possible in light of the ongoing audit of United Nations activities in the country; and  
(c) 
To approve the performance indicators for UNDP set out in Annex V to the present 
report. 
(Decision 71/20) 
(iii) 
UNEP 
79. 
The representative of UNEP introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/10. 
80. 
In response to a question on cooperation between UNEP and UNIDO, the representative of 
UNEP said that UNEP had cooperated with UNIDO on the implementation of HPMP projects and a 
project for countries with high ambient temperatures and that the two agencies had hosted a joint meeting 
on the implementation of HPMPs in Sub-Saharan African countries at UNIDO’s headquarters in Vienna 
from 26 to 29 November 2013. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
22 
81. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The 
2014-2016 
business 
plan 
of 
UNEP 
contained 
in 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/10;  
(ii) 
That stage II of HCFC phase-out management plans for low-volume-consuming 
(LVC) and non-LVC countries for which UNEP was the lead agency for stage I 
could increase the total business plan value (including values after 2020) by 
US $11,400,500 and US $6,737,826, respectively; and 
(b) 
To approve the performance indicators for UNEP set out in Tables 1 and 2 contained in 
Annex VI to the present report. 
(Decision 71/21) 
(iv) 
UNIDO 
82. 
The representative of UNIDO introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/11. 
83. 
In response to a question as to why there had been no reference to cooperation between UNEP 
and UNIDO in UNIDO’s business plan, the representative of UNIDO explained that its business plan 
presented a programme for future work and thus did not make reference to such already established 
projects as the joint activities of UNIDO and UNEP in countries with high ambient temperature.  
84. 
Questions were raised concerning the inclusion of demonstration projects for alternatives to MB 
for quarantine and pre-shipment applications in the business plan. It was pointed out that such 
demonstration projects had been removed from the business plan the previous year and that the use of MB 
in such applications was exempt from the compliance obligations. The issue was already being considered 
by other bodies such as the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee and it was suggested that it be 
addressed under the International Plant Protection Convention as well. 
85. 
The representative of UNIDO said that a number of factors made the demonstration projects 
timely. UNIDO had developed a budget for pilot projects to demonstrate the effectiveness of alternatives 
to MB for quarantine and pre-shipment applications and the Methyl Bromide Technical Options 
Committee had estimated that between 31 to 40 per cent of the MB being used could be replaced by 
alternatives. 
86. 
The representative of the Secretariat explained that phase-out activities involving swing plants 
had been removed from the business plan pursuant to decision 66/5(a)(v), according to which requests for 
such activities could be reintroduced into the business plans of the implementing agencies, as appropriate, 
after the Executive Committee had agreed on the HCFC production sector guidelines. 
87. 
One member said that while he understood the explanation provided by the Secretariat it was his 
view that the Sub-group on the Production Sector should continue to discuss the eligibility of phase-out 
activities for swing plants. 
88. 
UNIDO indicated that since ODS destruction projects for Algeria and Lebanon in 
the 2013 business plans were not submitted in 2013, they should be added to its business plan in 2014. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64

89. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the 2014-2016 business plan of UNIDO contained in document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/11;  
(b) 
To add the ODS destruction projects for Algeria and Lebanon in UNIDO’s business plan 
for 2014; and 
(c) 
To approve the performance indicators for UNIDO set out in Annex VII to the present 
report. 
 (Decision 71/22) 
(v) 
World Bank 
90. 
 The representative of the World Bank introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/12. 
91. 
Several members questioned both the projected start date for stage II for the HCFC production 
sector in China as it overlapped with the end of stage I, and the value of the project preparation activity 
foreseen for 2015.  It was also suggested that the amount of funding provided for stage II might need to 
be lowered as the level of funding indicated in the business plan was higher than the pro-rata share of 
the maximum amount remaining in the Agreement.  Given those considerations, it was suggested that 
further discussion of the issue continue in the Sub-group on the Production Sector. 
92. 
The facilitator of the Sub-group on the Production Sector reported that the Sub-group had 
recommended that the allocation related to the preparation of stage II of the HCFC production phase-out 
management plan (HPPMP) for China should be removed from the World Bank’s business plan for 
2014-2016, on the understanding that it could be reinstated at a later date for consideration by the 
Executive Committee, and that the allocation for implementation of stage II of the HPPMP for China 
should also be removed from that business plan, while noting that in 2016 China might decide to submit 
a proposal for stage II of the HPPMP to commence in 2017. 
93. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the 2014-2016 business plan of the World Bank contained in document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/12; 
(b) 
To remove the allocation related to the preparation of stage II of the HCFC production 
phase-out management plan (HPPMP) for China from the World Bank’s business plan 
for 2014-2016 on the understanding that it could be reinstated at a later date for 
consideration by the Executive Committee;  
(c) 
To remove the allocation for stage II of HPPMP implementation for the year 2016 in the 
World Bank’s 2014-2016 business plan, noting that China might decide to submit a 
proposal in 2016 for stage II of the HPPMP to commence in 2017; and 
(d) 
To approve the performance indicators for the World Bank set out in Annex VIII to the 
present report.

AGENDA ITEM 7: PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION 
(a) 
Monitoring and evaluation: 
(i) 
2013 consolidated project completion report 
94. 
The 
Senior 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Officer 
introduced 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/13. 
95. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To take note of the 2013 consolidated Project Completion Report (PCR) contained in 
document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/13, including the schedule for submission of PCRs 
due and the lessons learned; 
(b) 
To request the bilateral and implementing agencies concerned: 
(i) 
To establish by the end of January 2014, in cooperation with the Secretariat, full 
consistency of data reported in the PCRs in the Inventory of approved projects 
and in the annual progress reports;  
(ii) 
To provide to the Secretariat by the end of January 2014 the information still 
missing in a number of PCRs;  
(iii) 
To clear by the end of January 2014 the backlog of PCRs on projects completed 
before the end of 2006; and 
(c) 
To invite all those involved in the preparation and implementation of projects to take into 
consideration the lessons learned from PCRs when preparing and implementing future 
projects. 
(Decision 71/24) 
(ii) 
Desk study on the evaluation of the preparatory phase of the phasing out of HCFCs 
96. 
The 
Senior 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Officer 
introduced 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/14. 
97. 
In the ensuing discussion, it was pointed out that the information contained in the body of the 
report and the compilation were very valuable. Some of the conclusions drawn were questioned, however, 
and some members felt that the existing guidelines did not reflect the realities of LVC countries.  The 
need for simple, clear guidelines for the preparation of stage II of HPMPs was stressed. 
98. 
The Executive Committee decided to note the desk study on the evaluation of the preparatory 
phase 
of 
the 
phasing-out of 
HCFCs 
and 
its 
recommendations 
contained 
in document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/14.  
(Decision 71/25) 
(iii) 
Evaluation of metered-dose inhaler projects 
99. 
The 
Senior 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Officer 
introduced 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/15. In response to a request for clarification, she explained that, although the 
report was to have included six countries, she had been unable to obtain security clearance for Egypt and 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
25 
agreement on an acceptable date for a visit to India within a reasonable timeframe. She suggested that the 
current report be considered an interim report, while she could maintain the original sample size by 
identifying two additional countries for evaluation, and submit a final report to the 72nd meeting. 
100. 
After a discussion, the Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the report on the evaluation of projects for the conversion of CFC based metered 
dose 
inhalers 
(MDI) 
to 
non-CFC 
technologies, 
contained 
in 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/15, as an interim report; and  
(b) 
To request the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Officer to visit two additional countries 
and to submit a final report, with, inter alia, an analysis of the technology issues 
surrounding the conversion to alternative technologies, the conclusions and lessons 
learned, to the Executive Committee at its 72nd meeting.  
(Decision 71/26) 
(iv) 
Draft monitoring and evaluation work programme for the year 2014 
101. 
The 
Senior 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Officer 
introduced 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/15. 
102. 
Reservations were expressed regarding both the proposed evaluation of MB projects in Latin 
America and the Caribbean and the proposed evaluation of training in the refrigeration servicing sector. It 
was suggested that the two evaluations fell outside the scope of the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation 
Officer’s work, which was to evaluate the work procedures and guidelines provided by the Executive 
Committee, as well as the effectiveness of projects in achieving the Fund’s and projects’ objectives.  
There were also objections to the regional scale of the proposed MB evaluation as MB was a global issue. 
Suggestions were made for alternative evaluation studies, including a desk study and an evaluation of 
projects to phase out CFCs in the foam sector and a review of Fund procedures for monitoring and 
assessing progress. 
103. 
Following informal discussions, the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Officer invited the 
members of the Executive Committee to submit additional suggestions for alternative evaluations, which 
could be submitted until 15 January 2014. She would then prepare terms of reference for the suggested 
evaluations and present them to the 72nd meeting. In the interim, she would continue with ongoing 
activities, complete the evaluation of the projects for the conversion of CFC-based MDIs, and perform 
routine evaluation activities in preparation for the 72nd meeting. 
104. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the draft monitoring and evaluation work programme for the year 2014 contained 
in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/15; 
(b) 
To request the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Officer: 
(i) 
To prepare a revised monitoring and evaluation work programme for the year 
2014, taking into account the specific suggestions made at the present meeting 
and any additional suggestions for further study from Executive Committee 
members to be submitted to the Secretariat before 15 January 2014; and 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
26 
(ii) 
To present the revised work programme for the year 2014 to the Executive 
Committee at its 72nd meeting. 
(Decision 71/27) 
(b) 
Performance indicators (decision 70/14) 
105. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/17 and 
revised proposals for the performance indicators that had been developed in consultation with the 
implementing agencies. Clarification was sought regarding the weighting of the indicator for activities 
related to project completion and the indicator for funds being disbursed. The representative of the 
Secretariat explained that each progress report estimated the funding to be disbursed in the following 
reporting period so that it was possible to compare that estimate against the funds actually disbursed. He 
also explained that the indicator for project completion was based on the completion dates for each 
tranche, and that those dates were set by the implementing agencies and were reported in their progress 
reports. While the weighting of the indicators had been adjusted so that they were now comparable, 
several members asked for an additional adjustment to the weighting being proposed. 
106. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a)

AGENDA ITEM 8: PROJECT PROPOSALS 
(a) 
Overview of issues identified during project review 
107. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/18, which 
contained: an analysis of projects and activities submitted to the present meeting; the list of projects and 
activities submitted for blanket approval; and the list of investment projects submitted for individual 
consideration. Since issuing the documentation, three more projects had been withdrawn: a pilot 
demonstration project for ODS waste management and disposal and project preparation for MB both for 
Algeria by UNIDO, and the third tranche of stage I of the HPMP for the Islamic Republic of Iran by 
UNDP. 
108. 
While no new policy issues had been identified during the project review process, the Secretariat 
had identified barriers to the introduction of low-GWP technologies, particularly in the refrigeration and 
air-conditioning sectors. In response to a question on the barriers to the introduction of low-GWP 
technologies, the representative of the Secretariat explained that most of the alternatives in question were 
flammable. The substances currently used had been in use for some 50 years and many of the industrial 
codes and standards in place had never contemplated the use of flammable alternatives so existing 
regulations might prevent or constrain their use.  If introduced, those alternatives also had to be serviced 
and that would involve additional challenges that did not exist when non-flammable alternatives were 
used. In providing that information, the Secretariat wanted to ensure that the Executive Committee was 
aware of the different barriers to be addressed when introducing alternatives in new refrigeration and 
air-conditioning equipment. 
Fund disbursement threshold for tranches of HCFC phase-out management plans 
109. 
It was recalled that the main reason for tranche submission delays was the failure to meet the 
required 20 per cent disbursement threshold for the previous tranche of stage I of the HPMP. It appeared 
that the Secretariat had been applying that 20 per cent threshold flexibly, which suggested that 
compliance with the threshold should not be the only element being considered when approving the 
tranches of funding for stage I of the HPMPs as HCFC phase-out was a more complicated task and 
involved a number of complex sectors.  There was a need for a common understanding on the application 
of the 20 per cent disbursement threshold by the Secretariat, and several members suggested that the 
Secretariat be requested to prepare a brief review of its application, as well as other possible elements to 
be considered when approving tranches of funding, for the consideration of the Executive Committee at 
its 72nd meeting. 
110. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To confirm that achievement of the 20 per cent disbursement threshold provision should 
be determined in terms of the level of disbursement to final beneficiaries, where 
applicable; and 
(b) 
To request the Secretariat to review the application of the 20 per cent disbursement 
threshold provision for the 72nd meeting with a view to clarifying and ensuring its 
consistent application, and to enable consideration of alternative options for defining 
pre-conditions for submission of multi-year tranches. 
(Decision 71/29) 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64

List of projects and activities submitted for blanket approval 
111. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To approve the projects and activities submitted for blanket approval at the levels of 
funding indicated in Annex IX to the present report, together with the conditions or 
provisions included in the corresponding project evaluation documents and the conditions 
attached to the projects by the Executive Committee, noting that the agreements between 
the following Governments and the Executive Committee had been updated based on the 
established HCFC baseline for compliance and/or revised funding levels:  
(i) 
The Agreement between the Government of Cameroon and the Executive 
Committee contained in Annex X to the present report; 
(ii) 
The Agreement between the Government of Chile and the Executive Committee 
contained in Annex XI to the present report; 
(iii) 
The Agreement between the Government of the Gambia and the Executive 
Committee contained in Annex XII to the present report; 
(iv) 
The Agreement between the Government of Guinea-Bissau and the Executive 
Committee contained in Annex XIII to the present report; 
(v) 
The Agreement between the Government of Mongolia and the Executive 
Committee contained in Annex XIV to the present report; 
(vi) 
The Agreement between the Government of Serbia and the Executive Committee 
contained in Annex XV to the present report; 
(vii) 
The Agreement between the Government of Turkmenistan and the Executive 
Committee contained in Annex XVI to the present report; 
(viii) 
The Agreement between the Government of Zimbabwe and the Executive 
Committee contained in Annex XVII to the present report; and 
(b) 
That for projects related to renewal of institutional strengthening, blanket approval 
included approval of the observations to be communicated to recipient governments 
contained in Annex XVIII to the present report. 
(Decision 71/30) 
(b) 
Bilateral cooperation 
112. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/19 and 
explained that, following the request by UNIDO to defer the pilot demonstration project on ODS waste 
management and disposal for Algeria being jointly implemented by a bilateral agency, only five projects 
for bilateral cooperation, with a value of US $2,018,036, including support costs, had been submitted to 
the 71st meeting.  
113. 
The Executive Committee decided to request the Treasurer to offset US $1,927,636 (including 
agency fees) against the balance of Germany’s bilateral contribution for 2014 associated with the project 
approved at the 71st meeting.

(c) 
Amendments to work programmes for 2013 
(i) 
UNDP 
114. 
The Chair reminded the meeting that the funding requests in UNDP’s amendments to its 2013 
work programme, namely renewal of seven IS projects and three requests for technical assistance 
described in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/20, had already been approved under agenda item 8(a) 
(see paragraph 111 above). 
(ii) 
UNEP 
115. 
The Chair reminded the meeting that the funding requests in UNEP’s amendments to its 2013 
work programme, namely 25 activities including requests for 16 IS renewal projects, and nine requests for 
technical assistance described in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/21, had already been approved 
under agenda item 8(a) (see paragraph 111 above). 
(iii) 
UNIDO 
116. 
The Chair reminded the meeting that the funding requests in UNIDO’s amendments to its 2013 
work programme, namely 10 activities including requests for four IS renewal projects, one project 
preparation request for the phase-out of MB and four requests for technical assistance as described in 
document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/22 had already been approved under agenda item 8(a) (see 
paragraph 111 above).  She also said that one of the two activities submitted for individual consideration 
had been withdrawn by the agency and that the Secretariat had recently received the country programme 
implementation data for 2012 for Sudan, which was a prerequisite for approving the MB project 
preparation for that country and therefore the request could be approved. 
Sudan:  MB project preparation 
117. 
The Executive Committee decided to approve the funds for project preparation for the methyl 
bromide project for Sudan in the amount of US $30,000, plus agency support costs of US $2,100 for 
UNIDO. 
(Decision 71/32) 
(d) 
UNEP’s Compliance Assistance Programme (CAP) budget for 2014 
118. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/23, which 
contained the proposed 2014 budget for UNEP’s CAP. The submission represented a 2 per cent increase 
in the 2014 CAP budget compared with that approved for 2013. 
119. 
Some members noted the significant changes to the UNEP’s CAP budget and requested 
clarification of a variety of issues. 
120. 
In response, the representative of UNEP explained that ODS destruction had not been included in 
the list of main challenges facing Article 5 countries in 2014 because the Executive Committee had 
deemed ODS destruction not to be required for compliance and thus it did not fall within the mandate of 
UNEP’s CAP. 
121. 
She clarified that the budget reallocation from the Regional Office for Latin America and the 
Caribbean to the Regional Office for Africa and the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific had been 
done to reflect changing priorities. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
30 
122. 
In explaining the change in functional titles under the personnel budget lines, she informed the 
Committee that efforts were being made to ensure harmonization to reflect the tasks and responsibilities 
of staff members that had altered over time.  She gave an update on staff movements and efforts to 
advertise and fill vacant posts in a variety of budget lines in response to a query about the status of certain 
vacant posts.  She explained the re-prioritization and reinforcement of staffing in the Regional Office for 
Africa to meet emerging needs.  She also explained the changes in the budget for the information clearing 
house, saying that the budget had not decreased, but had simply been partly transferred to other budget 
lines to clarify what the funds would be used for. 
123. 
Regarding a question on the adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 
(IPSAS), starting in January 2014, she explained that there would be no impact on the return of the 
balance of CAP funds in future years, but it might lead to a delay in reporting.  She further cited an 
example of two network meetings originally scheduled in 2013 and part of the 2013 budget, but have had 
to be postponed for 2014 due to unforeseen circumstances.  Holding these meetings in early 2014 would 
imply that funds would have to come from the 2013 budget where it was originally included.  The return 
of the balances from the 2013 CAP budget to the closest meeting of the Executive Committee would 
therefore reflect that some funds were re-programmed for 2014. 
124. 
Regarding the number of meetings planned for 2014, which was deemed to be rather high, she 
explained that the CAP operated 10 regional networks, each of which met at least once a year. In addition, 
they also held thematic meetings on priority topics for the region in question. 
125. 
With respect to UNEP’s CAP response to the challenge of assisting countries in introducing 
low-GWP alternatives, she said that specific thematic meetings had been held in each region and 
discussions had taken place on providing training for National Ozone Units. 
126. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To approve the UNEP’s Compliance Assistance Programme (CAP) budget for 2014 in 
the amount of US $9,338,000, plus agency support costs of 8 per cent, amounting to 
US $747,040, as contained in Annex XIX to the present report; 
(b) 
To request UNEP, in future submissions of the CAP budget to continue: 
(i) 
To provide detailed information on the activities for which the global funds 
would be used; 
(ii) 
To extend the prioritization of funding between CAP budget lines so as to 
accommodate changing priorities, and to provide details on the reallocations 
made in its budget pursuant to decisions 47/24 and 50/26; 
(iii) 
To report on the current staff post levels and to inform the Executive Committee 
of any changes thereto, particularly in respect of any increased budget 
allocations; and 
(c) 
To request UNEP to report to the Executive Committee on the implications of its 
adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) in meeting the 
requirements of decision 35/36(d), requiring the return of the balances of CAP funds, by 
the 74th meeting.

2014 core unit costs for UNDP, UNIDO and the World Bank 
127. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/24, 
drawing attention to the 0.7 per cent increase in core unit costs requested by UNDP and UNIDO, and the 
World Bank’s request for the same budget as that approved in 2013. He highlighted issues with respect to 
distinguishing project implementation-related costs from administrative costs, using core unit funds as 
budgets, and staying within established agency norms for exceeding the allocated budget amounts. 
128. 
Following the introduction, one member pointed out that the issues raised by the representative of 
the Secretariat might better be discussed under agenda item 13 on the Terms of reference for the 
assessment of the administrative cost regime for the 2015-2017 triennium. 
129. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The report on 2014 core unit costs for UNDP, UNIDO and the World Bank 
contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/24;  
(ii) 
With appreciation, that the World Bank’s core unit operation was again below its 
budgeted level and that it would be returning unused balances; and 
(b) 
To approve the requested core unit budgets for UNDP of US $2,012,442, UNIDO of 
US $2,012,442, and the World Bank of US $1,725,000.

(UNDP/UNEP/UNIDO/World Bank/Germany/Japan) 
130. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced documents UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/30 and 
Add.1. On behalf of the Government of China, UNDP, UNEP, UNIDO and the World Bank, as the lead 
implementing agencies for the industrial and commercial refrigeration and air conditioning (ICR) and 
solvent (UNDP), refrigeration servicing (UNEP), extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam and room 
air-conditioner manufacturing (RAC) (UNIDO), and polyurethane rigid (PU) foam (World Bank) sectors, 
had submitted requests for funding for the next tranche of stage I of the HPMP. 
131. 
The review showed that a significant level of implementation of activities from the previous 
tranche had been achieved, except for the servicing sector.  The disbursement from agencies to the 
Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) of the Ministry of Environmental Protection had reached 
60.3  per cent and from FECO to beneficiary enterprises 20.6  per cent of the previous tranche, with more 
than 20 per cent disbursement for each sector plan except the servicing sector, where no disbursement of 
the previous tranche had been reported. The Government of China had confirmed that a licensing and 
quota system was being enforced, which would ensure compliance with the Montreal Protocol control 
levels despite consumption in 2012 being 9.5 per cent higher than the HCFC baseline.  
132. 
Members noted the significant progress that had been made, but expressed some concern at the 
low level of disbursement in previous tranches, which hovered around the 20 per cent required to enable 
disbursement of the next tranche. They questioned, therefore, whether the funds for the next tranche were 
really needed. Furthermore, there had been no disbursement at all to final beneficiaries in the PU foam 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
32 
sector, yet the Secretariat was recommending approval of the next tranche on the basis of 50 per cent 
disbursement to FECO. Several members questioned whether the 20 per cent disbursement threshold was 
performing its intended function. 
133. 
Regarding the issue of interest accrued by the Government of China, the representative of the 
Secretariat explained that interest accrued would be deducted from any funds due to the implementing 
agencies prior to transfer.  
134. 
A contact group was established to further discuss the matter. Following the report by the 
convener which included inter alia the importance of ensuring that implementing agencies submitted 
sufficiently detailed information within the required time- frame to support requests for disbursement of 
future tranches, the Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the progress reports on the implementation of the following tranches of stage I of 
the HCFC phase-out management plan for China: the first tranche of the solvent sector 
plan; and the second tranches of the extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam sector plan, the 
polyurethane rigid (PU) foam sector plan, the industrial and commercial refrigeration and 
air conditioning (ICR) sector plan, the room air-conditioner manufacturing (RAC) sector 
plan and refrigeration servicing sector plan, including the national enabling programme;  
(b) 
To approve the third tranche of stage I of the XPS foam sector plan for China and the 
corresponding 2014 tranche implementation plan, in the amount of US $3,998,000, plus 
agency support costs of US $279,860 for UNIDO, and to request the Treasurer to offset 
future transfers to UNIDO by US $11,955, representing interest accrued by the 
Government of China up to 31 December 2012 on funds previously transferred for the 
implementation of the XPS foam sector plan, as per decision 69/24; 
(c) 
To approve, on an exceptional basis,  the third tranche of stage I of the PU foam sector 
plan for China, and the corresponding 2014 tranche implementation plan, in the amount 
of US $13,592,000, plus agency support costs of US $951,440 for the World Bank, on the 
understanding that funding would be disbursed by the Treasurer to the World Bank only 
after the Secretariat had accepted as sufficient information provided by the World Bank 
to the effect that disbursement of 20 per cent or more of the second tranche to final 
beneficiaries had been achieved; 
(d) 
To approve the third tranche of stage I of the ICR sector plan for China, and the 
corresponding 2014-2015 tranche implementation plan, in the amount of US $8,495,000, 
plus agency support costs of US $594,650 for UNDP; and to request the Treasurer to 
offset future transfers to UNDP by US $70,627, representing interest accrued by the 
Government of China up to 31 December 2012 from funds previously transferred for the 
implementation of the ICR sector plan as per decision 69/24; 
(e) 
To approve the third tranche of stage I of the RAC sector plan for China, and the 
corresponding 2014-2015 tranche implementation plans, in the amount of US $8,495,000, 
plus agency support costs of US $594,650 for UNIDO; and to request the Treasurer to 
offset future transfers to UNIDO by US $9,513, representing interest accrued by the 
Government of China up to 31 December 2012 from funds previously transferred for the 
implementation of the RAC sector plan as per decision 69/24;  
(f) 
To approve the second tranche of stage I of the solvent sector plan for China, and the 
corresponding 2014-2015 tranche implementation plan, in the amount of US $2,000,000, 
plus agency support costs of US $140,000 for UNDP; and to request the Treasurer to 
offset future transfers to UNDP by US $2,289, representing interest accrued by the 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
33 
Government of China up to 31 December 2012 on funds previously transferred for the 
implementation of the solvent sector plan for China as per decision 69/24; and 
(g) 
To defer consideration of the third tranche of stage I of the refrigeration servicing sector 
plan and the national enabling programme for China to the 72nd meeting.

Croatia: HCFC phase-out management plan (stage I, fourth tranche) (UNIDO/Italy) 
135. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/32. 
136. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note the progress report on the implementation of the second and third tranches of 
the HCFC phase-out management plan (HPMP) for Croatia;  
(b) 
To approve the fourth (and final) tranche of the HPMP for Croatia, and the 
corresponding 2014 annual implementation plan, in the amount of US $60,000, plus 
agency support costs of US $4,500 for UNIDO; and 
(c) 
To request UNIDO and the Government of Italy to submit the project completion report 
of the HPMP for Croatia no later than the 74th meeting. 
(Decision 71/36) 
India: HCFC phase-out management plan (stage I, second tranche) (UNDP/UNEP/Germany) 
137. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/35. 
138. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note the progress report on the implementation of the first tranche of stage I of the 
HCFC phase-out management plan (HPMP) for India;  
(b) 
To note that the Fund Secretariat had updated Appendix 2-A of the Agreement between 
the Government of India and the Executive Committee to reflect the change in support 
costs owing to the new administrative cost regime, and that a new paragraph 16 had 
been added to indicate that the updated Agreement superseded that reached at the 
66th meeting, as contained in Annex XX to the present report; and 
(c) 
To approve the second tranche of stage I of the HPMP for India, and the corresponding 
2014-2015 tranche implementation plan, in the amount of US $8,846,064, consisting of 
US $7,000,000, plus agency support costs of US $490,000 for UNDP, US $344,640, 
plus agency support costs of US $41,910 for UNEP, and US $869,508, plus agency 
support costs of US $100,006 for the Government of Germany. 
(Decision 71/37) 
Indonesia: HCFC phase-out management plan (stage I, second tranche) (UNDP/World Bank) 
139. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/36. In 
response to a request for clarification regarding the level of disbursement, he confirmed that, even without 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
34 
taking into account the funds disbursed by the World Bank, for which there was a two-stage fund transfer 
process, disbursement had reached 23 per cent and was hence over the 20 per cent threshold. 
140. 
Responding to a question regarding the delayed implementation of foam component activities 
approved nearly three years previously, the representative of UNIDO explained that the funds could not 
be disbursed for those activities as agreement had not yet been reached on a contractual modality. 
141. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The progress report on the implementation of the first tranche of stage I of the 
HCFC phase-out management plan (HPMP) for Indonesia;  
(ii) 
That the Fund Secretariat had updated paragraph 1, Appendices 1-A and 2-A of 
the Agreement between the Government of Indonesia and the Executive 
Committee, based on the established HCFC baseline for compliance, and that a 
new paragraph 17 had been added to indicate that the updated Agreement 
superseded that reached at the 64th meeting, as contained in Annex XXI to the 
present report; 
(iii) 
That the revised starting point for sustained aggregate reduction in HCFC 
consumption was 403.9 ODP tonnes, calculated using actual consumption of 
374.8 ODP tonnes and 433.0 ODP tonnes reported for 2009 and 2010, 
respectively, under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol; and 
(b) 
To approve the second tranche of stage I of the HPMP for Indonesia, and the 
corresponding 2014-2015 tranche implementation plan, in the amount of US $5,313,475, 
consisting of US $4,000,000, plus agency support costs of US $300,000 for UNDP, and 
US $942,767, plus agency support costs of US $70,708 for the World Bank. 
(Decision 71/38) 
Montenegro: HCFC phase-out management plan (stage I, second tranche) (UNIDO) 
142. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/42. 
143. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The progress report on the implementation of the first tranche of stage I of the 
HCFC phase-out management plan (HPMP) for Montenegro;  
(ii) 
That the Fund Secretariat had updated paragraph 1, Appendices 1-A and 2-A of 
the Agreement between the Government of Montenegro and the Executive 
Committee, based on the established HCFC baseline for compliance and the 
revised funding level, and that a new paragraph 16 had been added to indicate 
that the updated Agreement superseded that reached at the 63rd meeting, as 
contained in Annex XXII to the present document;  
(iii) 
That the revised starting point for sustained aggregate reduction in HCFC 
consumption was 0.8 ODP tonnes, calculated using actual consumption of 
0.9 ODP tonnes and 0.6 ODP tonnes reported for 2009 and 2010, respectively, 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
35 
under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol and that the revised funding level for 
stage I of the HPMP for Montenegro was US $404,500, plus agency support 
costs, in accordance with decision 60/44(f)(xii); and 
(b) 
To approve the second tranche of stage I of the HPMP for Montenegro, and the 
corresponding 2014-2015 tranche implementation plan, at the amount of US $100,000, 
plus agency support costs of US $7,500 for UNIDO. 
(Decision 71/39) 
Namibia: HCFC phase-out management plan (second tranche) (Germany) 
144. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/43, 
indicating that consumption for 2011 was above the maximum allowable level in the Agreement because 
it included ODS consumption used to service foreign-owned ships. She also indicated that the 
Government of Namibia had provided a letter asserting its commitment to including the use of HCFC-22 
for servicing foreign-owned ships in its domestic consumption and to achieving compliance with the 
accelerated phase-out schedule provided in the Agreement. 
145. 
Following the presentation, concerns were raised about the fact that the commitment by the 
Government of Namibia to include in its domestic consumption the HCFC-22 used for servicing 
foreign-owned ships only applied from 2013 onward, and clarification was requested regarding its 
inclusion in the country’s consumption for 2012. It was further pointed out that Namibia had in fact 
included HCFC-22 use for servicing ships in its domestic consumption up to and including 2011. It 
seemed that 2012 was the only year for which the use was not included in domestic consumption. 
Clarification was also sought, and concern was expressed, with regard to the training and incentive 
programme provided by the bilateral agency. Of particular concern was the possibility that such 
equipment could be retrofitted to use hydrocarbons as part of a Multilateral Fund activity, in which case 
the absence of international standards and safety precautions could be problematic.  
146. 
It was proposed that an informal discussion take place among interested parties to clarify 
outstanding issues. During the informal discussion, Germany as the bilateral agency agreed to modify the 
work plan for the project to remove any Multilateral Fund funding from retrofits and devote them instead 
to replacement of HCFC-based equipment. On the matter of accounting for consumption in 2012, it had 
been determined that, even including the amount used for servicing foreign-owned ships in domestic 
consumption, consumption in 2012 had been below the target in the Agreement between Namibia and the 
Executive Committee. It was considered, however, that it was not desirable for countries suddenly to 
change the way in which they accounted for consumption.  Countries should therefore be requested to 
continue to use the method adopted when establishing their baseline for consumption when calculating 
consumption throughout the duration of their HPMPs. 
147. 
Following the discussion, the Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The progress report on the implementation of the first tranche of the HCFC 
phase-out management plan (HPMP) for Namibia;  
(ii) 
That the Fund Secretariat had updated paragraph 1, Appendices 1-A and 2-A of 
the Agreement between the Government of Namibia and the Executive 
Committee, based on the established HCFC baseline for compliance and the 
original HPMP submission, and that a new paragraph 16 had been added to 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
36 
indicate that the updated Agreement superseded that reached at the 63rd meeting, 
as contained in Annex XXIII to the present report; and 
(iii) 
That the revised starting point for sustained aggregate reduction in HCFC 
consumption was 8.4 ODP tonnes, calculated using actual consumption of 
6.0 ODP tonnes and 10.7 ODP tonnes reported for 2009 and 2010, respectively, 
under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol; 
(iv) 
That the 2011 consumption reported by the Government of Namibia exceeded 
the maximum allowable consumption by 1.08 ODP tonnes, as set out in row 1.2 
of its Agreement with the Executive Committee, as it included consumption of 
ODS used for servicing foreign-owned ships; 
(v) 
That the Government of Namibia had established a quota system to control the 
import and export of HCFCs, had committed to meeting the targets in its 
Agreement with the Executive Committee and had included the consumption of 
ODS used for servicing foreign-owned ships in its domestic consumption in its 
annual report under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol up to and including 2011, 
affirming that 2012 and subsequent domestic consumption reporting would 
include ODS used for servicing foreign-owned ships accordingly; and 
(b) 
To approve the second tranche of the HPMP for Namibia, and the corresponding revised 
2014-2017 tranche implementation plan with adjustments to focus the incentive 
programme only on replacement of HCFC-based equipment and not on retrofits, in the 
amount of US $240,000, plus agency support costs of US $29,067 for the Government of 
Germany.  
(Decision 71/40) 
Viet Nam: HCFC phase-out management plan (stage I, second tranche) (World Bank) 
148. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/52, 
pointing out that disbursement had reached over 20 per cent for the first tranche, that consumption was 
lower than the baseline, and that the licensing and quota system was being enforced.  
149. 
Following the presentation, questions were raised regarding the level of detail provided on 
activities undertaken during the first part of stage I, and the proposed implementation plan for 2014-2015. 
Of particular concern was the apparent reallocation of funds from HCFC-141b phase-out in the foam 
sector to HCFC-22 phase-out in the servicing sector. While the Agreement between the country and the 
Executive Committee included a flexibility clause that made it possible to reallocate up to 30 per cent of 
funding from the previous tranche, major changes to the HPMP required approval by the Executive 
Committee. It was therefore important to clarify that the sector change should be considered major.  
150. 
The representative of the World Bank clarified that the amount involved in the refrigeration 
servicing sector was part of the US $69,000 disbursed for studies and awareness-raising under the 
technical assistance component. Subsequent to the clarification, it was noted that the amount involved 
was not considered major in the financial sense; however, while the flexibility clause allowed transfers 
between budget lines, it might not pertain to transfers of funds to budget lines that did not exist in the 
original proposal and were not covered by the Agreement between the country and the Executive 
Committee, at least not without prior approval by the latter. 
151. 
In response to a question on energy-efficiency-related activities, the representative of the World 
Bank clarified that those activities were not being funded by the Multilateral Fund and had been included 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
37 
in the document for information purposes. It was pointed out by the Secretariat that, although there had 
been a shift in some funding to marginal HCFC-22 phase-out, there had been no negative impact on the 
original commitment to phase out HCFC-141b.  
152. 
Following the discussion, the Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note: 
(i) 
The progress report on the implementation of the first tranche of stage I of the 
HCFC phase-out management plan (HPMP) for Viet Nam;  
(ii) 
That the Fund Secretariat had updated paragraph 2, Appendices 1-A and 2-A of 
the Agreement between the Government of Viet Nam and the Executive 
Committee, based on the established HCFC baseline for compliance, and that a 
new paragraph 15 had been added to indicate that the updated Agreement 
superseded that reached at the 63rd meeting, as contained in Annex XXIV to the 
present report;  
(iii) 
That the revised starting point for sustained aggregate reduction in HCFC 
consumption was 221.21 ODP tonnes, calculated using actual consumption 
of 207.5 ODP tonnes and 234.9 ODP tonnes reported for 2009 and 2010, 
respectively, under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol, plus the average annual 
consumption of pre-blended polyol in the years 2007 to 2009 of 164.6 ODP 
tonnes, giving a total of 385.77 ODP tonnes; and 
(b) 
To approve the second tranche of stage I of the HPMP for Viet Nam and the 
corresponding 2014-2015 tranche implementation plan, in the amount of US $5,663,016, 
plus agency support costs of US $424,726 for the World Bank. 
(Decision 71/41) 
AGENDA ITEM 9: DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR FUNDING THE PREPARATION OF STAGE II 
OF HCFC PHASE-OUT MANAGEMENT PLANS (DECISIONS 66/5 AND 69/22 AND 
PARAGRAPH 105 OF UNEP/Ozl.Pro/ExCom/70/59) 
153. 
Following the introduction of document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/55 by the representative of 
the Secretariat, the Chair asked the contact group convened at the 70th meeting to discuss the draft 
guidelines and to report back to plenary later in the meeting. 
154. 
Reporting on the outcome of the discussions, the convener of the contact group informed the 
members that the group had come to agreement on the issues and had prepared recommendations for the

AGENDA ITEM 10: DISCUSSION PAPER ON MINIMIZING ADVERSE CLIMATE IMPACT 
OF HCFC PHASE-OUT IN THE REFRIGERATION SERVICING SECTOR (DECISION 68/11 
AND PARAGRAPH 120 OF UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/70/59) 
156. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/56, which 
summarized the discussions held at the 70th meeting on minimizing the adverse climate impact of HCFC 
phase-out in the refrigeration servicing sector. The paper provided an overview of the current 
refrigeration servicing sector, the experience gained from the phase-out of CFCs that was applicable to 
HCFC phase-out, and approaches to minimize adverse climate impacts during the implementation of 
activities for the servicing sector. 
157. 
One member said that a number of initiatives were under way in several countries, including on 
district cooling systems in Colombia and the Maldives. Not-in-kind alternatives offered a range of proven, 
available, safe, low-GWP alternatives and helped to reduce demand in the servicing sector. A number of 
investments also provided an opportunity for additional leveraging.  As the Multilateral Fund lacked 
experience with those technologies, he proposed requesting the Secretariat, in consultation with the 
implementing agencies, to produce a discussion paper on how systems with alternative technologies that 
minimized climate impact and improved energy efficiency could be considered for funding.   
158. 
Several members said that the document was useful and would help both Article 5 and 
non-Article 5 countries address the servicing sector. It presented, inter alia: proposed techniques for 
servicing refrigeration equipment; an analysis of the effect of good servicing practices, including the 
added benefit of recovery and recycling when compared with retrofitting; the safety issues related to the 
use of flammable gases; and the suggestion that there was a need to develop an impact analysis of the 
different technology options available. One member said that the issues raised in the document also 
related to the guidelines on preparation of stage II of HPMPs, although another member said that he could 
not accept the inclusion of the issues raised in the paper on the servicing sector in those guidelines. 
159. 
One member stressed the need for assistance to be provided to countries to help them address the 
issue of alternatives and it was suggested that the recommendation include other alternatives in addition 
to those that were flammable. While some members considered that the text of the recommendation did 
not impose any new obligations on Article 5 countries, others were not prepared to include in the 
recommendation any provision that encouraged Article 5 countries to introduce or adopt any standards or 
codes of good practice. One member also had reservations with respect to the climate impact indicator 
and considered that there was a need for further reflection on that issue.  
160. 
It was suggested that the Executive Committee continue its discussion of the document 
informally. 
161. 
Following informal discussions the Executive Committee decided to defer consideration of the 
document on minimizing the adverse climate impact of HCFC phase-out in the servicing sector 
(UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/56) until its 72nd meeting, on the understanding that sufficient time would be 
made available to the Executive Committee to discuss the document. 
(Decision 71/43) 
AGENDA ITEM 11: REVISED PAPER ON CRITERIA FOR FUNDING HCFC PHASE-OUT IN 
THE CONSUMPTION SECTOR ADOPTED BY DECISION 60/44 (DECISIONS 69/22(b), 
69/24(d) AND 70/21(c)) 
162. 
Introducing document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/57, the Chief Officer said that the Secretariat 
had revised the document initially presented to the 70th meeting to include, inter alia, information 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
41 
provided by relevant implementing agencies regarding incremental capital and operating costs incurred 
under stage I of HPMPs.  
163. 
He said that difficulties had been encountered in determining whether all of the costs incurred 
were eligible incremental costs as per the approved project proposals. The agencies had also had difficulty 
in providing the required information. In addition, the number of enterprises for which actual costs had 
already been paid was very small compared with the enterprises currently under conversion and did not 
cover all the alternative technologies selected so far.  
164. 
Based on the additional analysis undertaken, the Secretariat and all the implementing agencies 
considered that the criteria and guidelines currently in place could continue to be used when submitting 
new proposals, on the understanding that they could be further developed as new policy issues arose from 
their review. 
165. 
The Executive Committee took note of the document on the criteria for funding HCFC phase-out 
in 
the 
consumption 
sector 
adopted 
by 
decision 
60/44, 
contained 
in 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/57. 
AGENDA ITEM 12: DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS FOR THE HCFC PHASE-OUT 
MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR CHINA (DECISION 69/24(b)(i)) 
166. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/58, which 
had been prepared by the Secretariat with input from the implementing agencies. The Secretariat was 
proposing to study further the issue of fund transfers taking into account the Board of Auditors’ 
observations, the possibility of maximizing interest, the review of the Treasury function at the end of 
2014, and the impact of any change in policy on stage II of HPMPs and on project implementation. 
167. 
Clarifying the situation with regard to Treasury service, the representative of the Secretariat said 
that the term of the Treasurer had initially been set at five years at the 42nd meeting. At the end of that 
term, it had been extended indefinitely, meaning that no action needed to be taken by the Committee. 
However, the Secretariat had raised the issue as a change to the fund transfer policy could have 
implications for the requirements and cost of the Treasury function.  
168. 
The implementing agencies gave additional information on their disbursement modalities for the 
HPMP in China. The representative of UNDP said that the agency implemented projects using 
performance-based pay-outs as provided in the Agreement with the Government of China for the first 
tranche; funds were transferred once milestones had been achieved to enable FECO to sign agreements 
with beneficiary enterprises. If any policy changes were decided on by the Committee requiring that 
procedure to change, it could be applied only to new agreements signed for stage II. The representative of 
UNIDO said that his agency had a similar agreement with FECO, also based on milestones. UNIDO 
disbursed funds to FECO on the basis of its attainment of milestones and after the presentation of 
invoices. The representative of the World Bank said that the disbursement schedule used by the Bank was 
set out in its Agreement with FECO, which in general only asked for money once it had committed to a 
contract. 
169. 
In the ensuing discussion, it was noted that, on the basis of decision 69/24(b)(i), the Executive 
Committee had been expecting a paper proposing options for optimizing disbursement of funds to 
coincide with the need for disbursement to final beneficiaries in the HPMP for China. In this respect, 
work should continue on the basis of the decision taken at the 69th meeting. Given the wider implications 
of changes to policy, however, the Secretariat had preferred to revert to the Executive Committee for a 
broader mandate.  In response, it was suggested that the issues relating to fund transfer policy more 
generally be considered under Agenda item 14, Accounts of the Multilateral Fund. Another member 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
42 
requested that the rates of return on interest be taken into account in any further consideration of the 
disbursement issue.  
170. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the document on disbursement of funds for the HCFC phase-out management 
plan for China (decision 69/24(b)(i)) (UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/58); and 
(b) 
To request the Secretariat, in cooperation with the implementing agencies, to continue 
work pursuant to decision 69/24(b)(i) and to report any additional information to the 
Executive Committee at its 72nd meeting. 
(Decision 71/44) 
AGENDA ITEM 13: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE COST REGIME FOR THE 2015-2017 TRIENNIUM (DECISIONS 66/17(e) 
AND 68/10) 
171. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/59, 
explaining that, pursuant to decision 67/15, the administrative cost regime would be reviewed at the last 
meeting of 2014. The document proposed a number of options for carrying out a review, which could be 
conducted by the Secretariat, by an independent contractor, or by an expert group.  Issues that might be 
taken into account in the review included: the administrative costs attached to certain roles of the 
implementing agencies; the optimization of support costs; keeping the overall administrative cost ratio 
within the historical average or lower; the core unit cost structure; and the impact on administrative costs 
of the relative size of agencies administering funds. 
172. 
Following the introduction, a number of members recalled that a long discussion on the 
administrative cost regime had taken place at the 70th meeting, and expressed the view that changes to the 
regime should be given time to show their merit before being subjected to further changes. While an 
in-depth review did not seem necessary for the time being, some aspects of the administrative cost regime 
might benefit from examination.  As the item would be on the agenda of the last meeting of 2014, 
however, the best option appeared to be to request the Secretariat to provide basic information on the 
regime’s functioning, rather than undertaking a detailed review.  
173. 
Following the discussion, the Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note the options for assessment of the administrative cost regime for the 2015-2017 
triennium contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/59; and 
(b) 
To request the Secretariat to submit to the last meeting in 2014 a document reviewing the 
current administrative cost regime, in consideration of the administrative cost regime for 
the 2015-2017 triennium. 
(Decision 71/45) 
AGENDA ITEM 14: ACCOUNTS OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND 
(a) 
Final 2012 accounts 
174. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/60. A 
member suggested that the broader issue relating to fund transfer policy addressed in agenda item 12, 
Disbursement of funds for the HCFC phase-out management plan for China, be considered under the 
present item. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
43 
175. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note the final financial statements of the Multilateral Fund as at 31 December 2012 
contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/60; 
(b) 
To note that UNEP had yet to receive the final audit report of the 2012 accounts from the 
United Nations Board of Auditors; 
(c) 
To request the Treasurer to record in the 2013 accounts of the Multilateral Fund the 
differences between the implementing agencies’ provisional financial statements and their 
final 
2012 
accounts, 
as 
reflected 
in 
Tables 
1 
and 
2 
of 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/60; 
(d) 
To request the Treasurer to report to the Executive Committee at its 72nd meeting on the: 
(i) 
Consolidation of the Multilateral Fund accounts with those of UNEP under the 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards; 
(ii) 
Mitigation of exchange rate risks on pledged contributions;  
(iii) 
Procedures set by the UNEP-wide standard on cash advances and the potential 
impact on Multilateral Fund-funded project implementation; and 
(e) 
To request the Secretariat, in cooperation with the implementing agencies and the 
Treasurer, to further consider the impact of fund transfers to implementing agencies 
from the Treasurer, including information on rates of return on interest, in the light of the 
information provided in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/58, and to report back to 
the Executive Committee at its 72nd meeting. 
(Decision 71/46) 
(b) 
Reconciliation of the accounts 
176. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/61. She 
drew attention to the fact that the US $12 outstanding reconciling item between the approved amounts and 
the income of UNDP, reflected in Table 3 of the document, was related to a historical difference in 
income that should be withheld by the Treasurer against future transfers to UNDP and not to the balance 
returned for the project LEB/FUM/47/INV/61, as stated in the document. 
177. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To note the reconciliation of the 2012 accounts, as presented in document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/61; 
(b) 
To request UNEP to adjust its income by US $11,982 in interest accrued and US $3,675 
in prior years’ savings in its next progress report; 
(c) 
To request the Treasurer: 
(i) 
To reflect in UNIDO’s 2013 accounts as prior years’ adjustment: 
a. 
Income transfers made to UNIDO in 2012 related to the refund on 
completed projects amounting to US $104,472;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
44 
b. 
Interest earned amounting to US $221,896 for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 
2012, as adjusted at the 68th meeting;  
c. 
US $99,041 for the 4th quarter of 2012, as adjusted at the 69th meeting;  
d. 
The difference in interest income between the provisional and final 
accounts for 2012, amounting to US $50,951;  
(ii) 
To withhold from future transfers to UNDP an amount of US $551,278, 
representing the additional interest income reported by UNDP in its final 
financial statement but not in its provisional financial statement, and a US $12 
historical difference in income, and to reflect these amounts as a prior year 
adjustment in UNDP’s 2013 accounts;  
(iii) 
To withhold from future transfers to the World Bank an amount of US $71,078, 
representing interest earned in the 4th quarter of 2011, which had not been 
deducted from the 2012 approvals, as the Treasurer had made no payments to the 
World Bank at the 66th and 67th meetings owing to a large return in balances; and 
(iv) 
To note that the adjustments of US $2,880 returned twice by UNIDO against five 
projects, and US $810 in agency support costs returned twice by UNEP against 
one project, had been effected in the report on balances and availability of 
resources (document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/4) for each agency separately;  
(d) 
To note the 2012 outstanding reconciling items as follows: 
(i) 
US $3,119 in income between UNEP’s progress report and final accounts;  
(ii) 
US $15 in income and US $1,197 in expenditure between UNIDO’s progress 
report and final accounts; and 
(iii) 
US $9 in income between the World Bank’s progress report and final accounts; 
and 
(e) 
To note the standing reconciling items as follows: 
(i) 
UNDP for unspecified projects in the amounts of US $68,300 and US $29,054; 
and 
(ii) 
World Bank for the following projects implementing with other bilateral agencies 
where applicable: 
- 
Thailand chiller project (THA/REF/26/INV/104) in the amount of 
US $1,198,946; 
- 
Sweden bilateral (THA/HAL/29/TAS/120) in the amount of US $225,985; 
- 
United States of America bilateral (CPR/PRO/44/INV/425) in the amount of 
US $5,375,000; and 
- 
United States of America bilateral (CPR/PRO/47/INV/439) in the amount of 
US $5,375,000.

AGENDA ITEM 15: REVISED 2013, 2014 AND 2015 AND PROPOSED 2016 BUDGETS OF THE 
FUND SECRETARIAT 
178. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/62. 
179. 
While recognizing the importance of the Secretariat’s role in facilitating the Executive 
Committee’s work, members raised a number of concerns, most notably regarding staff upgrades and the 
cost differential of holding two meetings a year rather than three. One member also wished to discuss a 
different approach to document production that could have budgetary implications. A small informal 
discussion group was therefore set up.  
180. 
Subsequently, the representative of the Secretariat informed the Committee that the informal 
group had discussed a number of issues. Concerning the process related to the classification exercise that 
led to the proposed upgrade of two posts from the GS to the P categories, she clarified that in 2012, 
UNEP’s administration had requested UNON to identify an independent classification expert to conduct a 
classification review for both the Secretariats of the Multilateral Fund and the SCBD which were being 
administered by UNEP. Based on the results of the classification review, the Secretariat’s budget reflected 
the 
upgrade 
of 
the 
two 
posts. 
She 
also 
reported 
that 
a 
corrigendum 
to 
document 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/62 had been issued to further clarify the process that led to the 
reclassifications of the two posts. However, some members were of the view that the upgrade should be 
withheld pending further information on the matter to be provided to the next meeting of the Executive 
Committee. 
181. 
In regard to the revised costing of Executive Committee meetings, she explained that the costs 
were based on actual translation costs paid for prior meetings, the need to provide translation and 
interpretation in one additional language in 2014, and adjustments on costs for the rental of equipment 
and premises due to inflation. However, after a further review, it was feasible to reduce the Executive 
Committee budget line for meetings by US $40,000, noting that the reductions would not affect the 
overall performance of the meeting or the quality of the documents prepared for consideration by the 
Committee. Concerning the costs associated with travel on official mission, she explained that a number 
of missions by the Chief Officer and the Secretariat staff including those associated with the Open-Ended 
Working Group and the Parties would be expected in 2014; therefore, the requested amount was 
maintained at the proposed level, on the understanding that the Secretariat would report on tentative travel 
plans for official missions. 
182. 
Concerning the request for a revision of the programme support cost applied to personnel 
component, she explained that as the matter was not within the purview of the Secretariat it would need to 
consult with UNEP and consider the potential implications for reviewing the level of support costs. 
Therefore, it was agreed that the current rate of support costs should be maintained at the same level in 
the 2014 and 2015 approved budgets and the 2016 proposed budget, on the understanding that UNEP, 
through the Secretariat, would provide options for cost savings through a reduced rate by the 
72nd meeting. She also reported that the Secretariat budget document would be presented in a different 
format by adding an additional column reflecting the actual expenditures of the prior year after closing of 
the accounts, providing estimated operational costs for all years covered under the budget, a brief 
narrative of the budget lines, and information on expected missions to be undertaken during the current 
budget year. 
183. 
The Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To take note of the revised 2013, 2014, 2015 and proposed 2016 budgets of the Fund 
Secretariat, as contained in Annex XXV to the present report; 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
46 
(b) 
To approve the revised 2013 budget to reflect transfers between budget lines (BLs) 1101 
and 1102 and transfers between BL 1333 and BL1334, noting that the total budget of 
US $7,067,547 remained at the same level as approved at the 68th meeting; 
(c) 
To approve the revised 2014 budget in the amount of US $6,983,852 to reflect: 
(i) 
An additional amount of US $2,819,031 to cover the operational costs; 
(ii) 
Maintaining the posts 1301 and 1310 at G7 level in 2014, 2015 and 2016, 
pending further information; 
(d) 
To note the approved staff component costs of the 2015 budget totalling US $4,287,391 
which included programme support costs; 
(e) 
To approve the proposed staff component costs of the 2016 budget totalling 
US $4,416,013, including programme support costs; 
(f) 
To request the Secretariat to discuss with UNEP options for cost savings through reduced 
programme support costs, including an 8 per cent programme support cost rate scenario, 
and potential implications on the provision of services and staffing, including a detailed 
breakdown of programme support costs, and to report to the Executive Committee by the 
72nd  meeting;  
(g) 
To request the Secretariat to resubmit the revised 2014 and 2015 and proposed 2016 
budgets, based on a revised format; and 
(h) 
To request the Secretariat to submit to the 72nd meeting information on options regarding 
the reclassification results and the financial and operational implications of those options 
for the Multilateral Fund.  
(Decision 71/48) 
AGENDA ITEM 16: RECRUITMENT PROCESS FOR THE POSITION OF CHIEF OFFICER 
OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND SECRETARIAT (DECISION 70/27) 
184. 
The Chair of the Executive Committee provided the meeting with an oral report on the process of 
the selection of the Chief Officer of the Multilateral Fund Secretariat, as requested by decision 70/27(c).  
185. 
She recalled that the top eight candidates had been interviewed and that three of them had been 
unanimously recommended by the Selection Panel in a report finalized a few days after the Thirty-third 
Meeting of the Open-ended Working Group. The report had been submitted to the Executive Director of 
UNEP for onward transmission to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In September 2014, 
Executive Committee members had been informed of the appointment of Mr. Eduardo Ganem, just ahead 
of the official announcement. The Chair welcomed Mr. Ganem to his new position and wished him well 
for his first meeting as Chief Officer. 
186. 
Executive Committee members and representatives of the implementing agencies joined her in 
congratulating Mr. Ganem on his appointment. They highlighted his important contribution and 
dedication to the work of the Fund to date and expressed their confidence in his continued service to the 
institution. He could count on their support. 
187. 
Members also thanked UNEP, its staff and all those involved in the recruitment process for their 
diligence and timely efforts to ensure a seamless transition and especially for recognizing the importance 
of involving the Executive Committee fully in the process.

188. 
Mr. Ganem thanked the Executive Committee and the implementing agencies, saying he was 
honoured to be at the present meeting in his new capacity. He said that he was extremely lucky to be 
working with such an outstanding team within the Secretariat and that they would do their utmost to 
ensure that they continued to provide the Committee with the highest possible level of assistance. 
AGENDA ITEM 17: REPORT OF THE PRODUCTION SECTOR SUB-GROUP 
189. 
The representative of Canada, as facilitator of the Sub-group on the Production Sector, presented 
the report of the Sub-group on its deliberations (UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/63) and made two technical 
corrections to it orally. He said the Sub-group had reached agreement on all issues except the draft HCFC 
production sector guidelines.   
190. 
He was pleased to announce that there had been agreement on the HPPMP for China, which had 
been agreed in principle at the 69th meeting but which had required additional discussion in order to 
finalize the framework Agreement and the conditions for stage I of the Agreement. The Sub-group had 
recommended that an additional paragraph be included in the framework Agreement to reflect the fact 
that China had agreed to ensure that any compensated plant did not redirect any phased-out HCFC 
production capacity toward feedstock, subject to a penalty to be specified in the Agreement for each stage 
of the HPPMP. 
191. 
Agreement had also been reached on modifications to China’s CFC production sector phase-out 
plan to permit exemptions for the production of CFCs for essential uses approved for other Parties, which 
in the present case was the Russian Federation. The Sub-group had also addressed the issues which 
related to stage II of the HPPMP for China, as contained in the World Bank’s business plan for 
2014-2016 (see paragraphs 91-93 above). 
Revised draft Agreement between the Government of China and the Executive Committee of the 
Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol for the phase-out of 
production of HCFCs (HPPMP) 
192. Based on the report from the facilitator of the Sub-group on the Production Sector the Executive 
Committee decided: 
(a) 
To note the revised draft Agreement between the Government of China and the Executive 
Committee for the phase-out of production of HCFCs (HPPMP) as contained in Annex I 
of document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/63; 
(b) 
To agree a penalty for exceeding agreed production limits of US $1.73 per kg/year; 
(c) 
To agree a penalty for redirection of production for controlled uses to production for 
feedstock of US $0.15 per kg/year; and 
(d) 
To approve the Agreement between the Government of China and the Executive 
Committee for the HPPMP, contained in Annex XXVI to the present report. 
(Decision 71/49) 
Modification of China’s CFC production sector phase-out plan to permit exemptions for the 
production of CFCs for essential uses approved for other Parties for 2014 
193. 
Based on the report from the facilitator of the Sub-group on the Production Sector the Executive 
Committee decided: 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
48 
(a) 
To note the modification of China’s CFC production sector phase-out plan to permit 
exemptions for the production of CFCs for essential uses approved for other parties 
for 2014 as contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/SGP/5; 
(b) 
To modify the CFC production sector Agreement for China to allow the production for 
export of pharmaceutical-grade CFCs in 2014, with an annual review, for purposes of 
meeting the 2014 essential use exemption for metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) authorized 
by the Parties in decision XXV/2 for the other countries, provided that the exporting 
country had reporting and verification systems in place and that the reporting and 
verification systems collected and reported on the following information: 
(i) 
Documents from MDI manufacturers ordering pharmaceutical-grade CFCs; 
(ii) 
Approvals from importing country governments for purchasing essential use 
pharmaceutical-grade CFCs; 
(iii) 
Approvals received from governments of MDI-producing countries that ordered 
pharmaceutical-grade CFCs and the essential production authorized; 
(iv) 
Raw materials consumed for the production run; 
(v) 
Amount of pharmaceutical-grade CFC produced; 
(vi) 
Amount of non-pharmaceutical-grade CFC produced; 
(vii) 
Documentation (transport, storage, disposal) verifying that the amount of 
non-pharmaceutical CFCs had been destroyed; 
(viii) 
 Export documentation from producers; 
(ix) 
Invoices from MDI manufacturers; 
(x) 
Audit reports verifying all the above; 
(c) 
To request the World Bank, as the implementing agency for the CFC production 
phase-out plan for China, to provide its services in carrying out the verification/audit and 
to submit reports to the Executive Committee on behalf of China on the understanding 
that: 
(i) 
The World Bank verified that the producer had access to destroy the excess CFCs 
produced using a destruction technique approved by the Parties; 
(ii) 
The cost of verification would be approved in advance of the audit by the 
Executive Committee; and 
(d) 
That:  
(i) 
The Secretariat, on behalf of the Executive Committee, would seek confirmation 
from the importing country of the actual quantities imported by that country; 
(ii) 
The producing country agreed to limit the production of non-pharmaceutical 
specification grade CFCs to the extent possible and pay for their destruction; and

any CFC production determined as being excessive by the verification reports. 
(Decision 71/50) 
AGENDA ITEM 18: OTHER MATTERS 
Follow up to decision XXV/5 of the Meeting of the Parties 
194. 
As proposed during the Organization of work at the beginning of the meeting (Agenda item 2(b)), 
the issue of how to implement decision XXV/5 of the Twenty-fifth Meeting of the Parties was raised for 
discussion. Decision XXV/5 requested the Executive Committee to consider the information provided in 
the report on additional information on alternatives to ODS substances prepared by the TEAP pursuant to 
decision XXIV/7 of the Twenty-fourth Meeting and other related reports, with a view to considering 
whether additional demonstration projects to validate low-GWP-potential alternatives and technologies, 
together with additional activities to maximize the climate benefits, would be useful in assisting Article 5 
parties in further minimizing the environmental impact of  HCFC phase-out. 
195. 
In addition to the documents mentioned in the decision by the Meeting of the Parties, a further 
proposal was made to request the Secretariat, in consultation with the bilateral and implementing 
agencies, to prepare a discussion paper for consideration by the Executive Committee at its 72nd meeting 
on how various systems with alternative technologies minimized environmental and climate impacts. It 
was also suggested that the discussion document should provide an overview of the demonstration 
projects funded by the Multilateral Fund so far, and describe the regional distribution and technology 
involved in such projects. The scope of the discussion paper should be broad, with a view to using the 
information therein to decide whether to proceed any further and how to do so.  It should take into 
account 
documents 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/6/Add.1 
(Parts 
IX 
and 
XII) 
and 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/56, on a number of initiatives related to the adoption of alternative 
technologies to ODS that were under way or had been introduced in several countries, and the 
information in TEAP’s 2012 progress report referred to in decision XXIV/7 of the Twenty-fourth Meeting 
of the Parties regarding additional information on alternatives to ODS. 
196. 
Following the discussion, the Executive Committee decided:  
(a) 
To request the Secretariat to prepare for the 72nd meeting: 
(i) 
An overview of approved HCFC demonstration projects, including countries and 
regions covered, and technologies selected; 
(ii) 
A discussion paper, in consultation with the bilateral and implementing agencies, 
on options for a number of additional projects to demonstrate climate-friendly 
and energy-efficient  alternative technologies to HCFCs, including not-in-kind 
technologies, taking into account discussion during the 71st meeting; and 
(b) 
To consider at the 72nd meeting issues related to the additional activities to maximize 
climate benefits in the HCFC production sector. 
(Decision 71/51) 
Dates and venues of meetings of the Executive Committee in 2014 
197. 
The representative of the Secretariat introduced document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/Inf.2 
containing various options for the dates of the 72nd and 73rd meetings. The Chief Officer informed the 
members that holding the 73rd meeting back-to-back with the Meeting of the Parties could have budgetary 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
 
 
50 
implications for the Secretariat as no decision had yet been taken on the venue.  The Executive 
Committee would be informed of the venue when the decision had been taken.  
198. 
The Executive Committee decided: 
(a) 
To hold its 72nd meeting in Montreal from 12 to 16 May 2014; and  
(b) 
To hold its 73rd meeting from 9 to 13 November 2014 back-to-back with the 
Twenty-sixth Meeting of the Parties at the venue to be decided. 
(Decision 71/52) 
AGENDA ITEM 19: ADOPTION OF THE REPORT 
199. 
The Executive Committee adopted its report on the basis of the draft report contained in 
documents UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/L.1 and Add.1. 
AGENDA ITEM 20: CLOSURE OF THE MEETING 
200. 
At the end of the meeting, on the occasion of the retirement of Ms. Suely Carvalho of UNDP and 
Mr. Sidi Menad Si Ahmed of UNIDO, the Executive Committee, the implementing agencies and the 
Fund Secretariat paid tribute to their outstanding contribution to the Montreal Protocol, emphasizing their 
constant support and unwavering commitment to its success. 
201.

Noted that the Agreement was updated based on the established 
HCFC baseline for compliance and the original HPMP 
submission; that the revised starting point for sustained aggregate 
reduction in HCFC consumption was 8.4 ODP tonnes, calculated 
using actual consumption of 6.0 ODP tonnes and 10.7 ODP tonnes 
reported for 2009 and 2010, respectively, under Article 7 of the 
Montreal Protocol; that the 2011 consumption reported by the 
Government of Namibia exceeded the maximum allowable 
consumption by 1.08 ODP tonnes, as set out in row 1.2 of its 
Agreement with the Executive Committee, as it included 
consumption of ODS used for servicing foreign-owned ships; and 
that the Government of Namibia had established a quota system to 
control the import and export of HCFCs, had committed to 
meeting the targets in its Agreement with the Executive 
Committee and had included the consumption of ODS used for 
servicing foreign-owned ships in its domestic consumption in its 
annual report under Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol up to and 
including 2011, affirming that 2012 and subsequent domestic 
consumption reporting would include ODS used for servicing 
foreign-owned ships accordingly; and approved the corresponding 
revised 2014-2017 tranche implementation plan with adjustments 
to focus the incentive programme only on replacement of HCFC-
based equipment and not on retrofits.

Annex X 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
CAMEROON AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR 
THE REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of the Republic of Cameroon 
(the “Country”) and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 
65.9 ODP tonnes by 1 January 2017 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules. 
 
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal 
Protocol reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A.  The Country accepts that, by 
its acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“Maximum allowable total consumption of Annex C, Group I Substances”) as 
the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A, and in 
respect to any consumption of each of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in rows 4.1.3 and 
4.2.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees in principle to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A (“The 
Targets, and Funding”) to the Country.  The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this funding 
at the Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval Schedule”). 
 
4. 
In accordance with sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, the Country will accept independent 
verification of the achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in row 1.2 of 
Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) of this Agreement.  The aforementioned verification will be 
commissioned by the relevant bilateral or implementing agency. 
 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least 60 days prior to the applicable 
Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
 
(a) 
That the Country has met the Targets for all relevant years. Relevant years are all years 
since the year in which the hydrochlorofluorocarbons phase-out management plan 
(HPMP) was approved.  Exempt are years for which no obligation for reporting of 
country programme data exists at the date of the Executive Committee Meeting at which 
the funding request is being presented; 
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, except if the 
Executive Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted annual implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each previous 
calendar year, that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of activities 
initiated with previously approved tranches, and that the rate of disbursement of funding 
available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent; 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex X 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted and received approval from the Executive Committee for 
a tranche implementation plan in the form of Appendix 4-A (the “Format of Tranche 
Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each calendar year until and including the 
year for which the funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in 
case of the final tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th Meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the Country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol 
HCFC phase-out schedule for the duration of this Agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous annual implementation plans in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in paragraph 4 above. 
 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
reduction of consumption and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A.   
 
(a) 
Reallocations categorized as major changes must be documented in advance in an annual 
implementation plan and approved by the Executive Committee as described in 
sub-paragraph 5(d) above.  Major changes would relate to issues potentially concerning 
the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund; changes which would modify any clause 
of this Agreement; changes in the annual levels of funding allocated to individual 
bilateral or implementing agencies for the different tranches; and provision of funding for 
programmes or activities not included in the current endorsed annual implementation 
plan, or removal of an activity in the annual implementation plan, with a cost greater than 
30 per cent of the total cost of the tranche; 
(b) 
Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
annual implementation plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the 
Executive Committee in the annual implementation report; and 
(c) 
Any remaining funds will be returned to the Multilateral Fund upon closure of the last 
tranche of the plan.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  UNIDO has agreed to be the single lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) in respect of 
the Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to evaluations, which might be carried 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex X 
 
 
3 
out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral Fund or under the 
evaluation programme of any of the agencies taking part in this Agreement. 
 
10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for carrying out the activities of the overall plan with the 
changes approved as part of the subsequent submissions, including but not limited to independent 
verification as per sub-paragraph 5(b). The Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the 
Lead IA with the fees set out in row 2.2 of Appendix 2-A. 
 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule.  The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amount set out in Appendix 7-A in respect of each ODP kg of 
reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The Executive Committee will discuss each 
specific case in which the Country did not comply with this Agreement, and take related decisions. Once 
these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an impediment for future tranches as per 
paragraph 5 above. 
 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee and the Lead 
IA to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the Lead IA with access to 
information necessary to verify compliance with this Agreement. 
 
14. 
The completion of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end of the year 
following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption has been specified in 
Appendix 2-A. Should at that time activities be still outstanding which were foreseen in the Plan and its 
subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the completion will be delayed until the 
end of the year following the implementation of the remaining activities.  The reporting requirements as 
per sub-paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 1(d), and 1(e) of Appendix 4-A continue until the time of the completion if 
not specified by the Executive Committee otherwise. 
 
15. 
All of the conditions set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement have the meaning 
ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein. 
 
16. 
This updated Agreement supersedes the Agreement reached between the Government of 
Cameroon and the Executive Committee at the 64th meeting of the Executive Committee.

its acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“maximum allowable total consumption of Annex C, Group I Substances”; the 
Target) as the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances specified in 
Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of each of the Substances which exceeds the level 
defined in rows 4.1.3, 4.2.3, 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.5.3 and 4.6.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees in principle to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A 
(“Targets and Funding”) to the Country.  The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this 
funding at the Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval

(c) 
That the Country had submitted tranche implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each 
previous calendar year, that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of 
activities initiated with previously approved tranches, and that the rate of disbursement of 
funding available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent;  
(d) 
That the Country has submitted and received approval from the Executive Committee for 
a tranche implementation plan in the form of Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche 
Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each calendar year until and including the 
year for which the funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in 
case of the final tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th Meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol HCFC 
phase-out schedule for the duration of this agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous tranche implementation plan in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in sub-paragraph 5(b). 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
phase-down and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A.  Reallocations categorized as 
major changes must be documented in advance in a Tranche Implementation Plan and approved by the 
Executive Committee as described in sub-paragraph 5(d).  Major changes would relate to reallocations 
affecting in total 30 per cent or more of the funding of the last approved tranche, issues potentially 
concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund, or changes which would modify any clause of 
this Agreement. Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
Tranche Implementation Plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the Executive 
Committee in the Tranche Implementation Report.  Any remaining funds will be returned to the 
Multilateral Fund upon closure of the last tranche of the plan.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement. UNDP has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) and UNEP has agreed 
to be cooperating implementing agency (the “Cooperating IA”) under the lead of the Lead IA in respect 
of the Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to evaluations, which might be 
carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral Fund or under the 
evaluation programme of any of the agencies taking part in this Agreement.

10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for carrying out the activities of the plan as detailed in the first 
submission of the HPMP with the changes approved as part of the subsequent tranche submissions, 
including but not limited to independent verification as per sub-paragraph 5(b).  This responsibility 
includes the necessity to co-ordinate with the Cooperating IA to ensure appropriate timing and sequence 
of activities in the implementation. The Cooperating IA will support the Lead IA by implementing the 
activities listed in Appendix 6-B under the overall co-ordination of the Lead IA.  The Lead IA and 
Cooperating IA have entered into a formal agreement regarding planning, reporting and responsibilities 
under this Agreement to facilitate a co-ordinated implementation of the Plan, including regular 
co-ordination meetings.  The Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA and the 
Cooperating IA with the fees set out in rows 2.2 and 2.4 of Appendix 2-A. 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule.  The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amounts set out in Appendix 7-A in respect of each ODP tonne of 
reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The Executive Committee will discuss each 
specific case in which the Country did not comply with this Agreement, and take related decisions. Once 
these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an impediment for future tranches as per 
paragraph 5. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country.

APPENDIX 3-A: FUNDING APPROVAL SCHEDULE 
 
1. 
Funding for the future tranches will be considered for approval not earlier than the first meeting 
of the year specified in Appendix 2-A. 
 
APPENDIX 4-A: FORMAT OF TRANCHE IMPLEMENTATION REPORTS AND PLANS 
 
1. 
The submission of the Tranche Implementation Report and Plan will consist of five parts: 
(a) 
A narrative report regarding the progress in the previous tranche, reflecting on the 
situation of the Country in regard to phase out of the Substances, how the different 
activities contribute to it and how they relate to each other.  The report should further 
highlight successes, experiences and challenges related to the different activities included 
in the Plan, reflecting on changes in the circumstances in the Country, and providing 
other relevant information. The report should also include information about and 
justification for any changes vis-à-vis the previously submitted tranche plan, such as 
delays, uses of the flexibility for reallocation of funds during implementation of a 
tranche, as provided for in paragraph 7 of this Agreement, or other changes. The narrative 
report will cover all relevant years specified in sub-paragraph 5(a) of the Agreement and 
can in addition also include information about activities in the current year; 
(b) 
A verification report of the HPMP results and the consumption of the Substances 
mentioned in Appendix 1-A, as per sub-paragraph 5(b) of the Agreement. If not decided 
otherwise by the Executive Committee, such a verification has to be provided together 
with each tranche request and will have to provide verification of the consumption for all 
relevant years as specified in sub-paragraph 5(a) of the Agreement for which a 
verification report has not yet been acknowledged by the Committee; 
(c) 
A written description of the activities to be undertaken in the next tranche, highlighting 
their interdependence, and taking into account experiences made and progress achieved 
in the implementation of earlier tranches.  The description should also include a reference 
to the overall Plan and progress achieved, as well as any possible changes to the overall 
plan foreseen.  The description should cover the years specified in sub-paragraph 5(d) of 
the Agreement.  The description should also specify and explain any revisions to the 
overall plan which were found to be necessary;  
(d) 
A set of quantitative information for the report and plan, submitted into a database. As 
per the relevant decisions of the Executive Committee in respect to the format required, 
the data should be submitted online. This quantitative information, to be submitted by 
calendar year with each tranche request, will be amending the narratives and description 
for the report (see sub-paragraph 1(a) above) and the plan (see sub-paragraph 1(c) above), 
and will cover the same time periods and activities; it will also capture the quantitative 
information regarding any necessary revisions of the overall plan as per 
sub-paragraph 1(c) above. While the quantitative information is required only for 
previous and future years, the format will include the option to submit in addition 
information regarding the current year if desired by the Country and the Lead IA; and 
(e) 
An Executive Summary of about five paragraphs, summarizing the information of above 
sub-paragraphs 1(a) to 1(d).

APPENDIX 5-A: MONITORING INSTITUTIONS AND ROLES  
 
1. 
The National Ozone Unit (NOU) of the Ministry of Environment shall be responsible for 
coordinating the various actions associated with each strategic line. In order to carry this out, the NOU 
will coordinate with the different areas of the institution, such as regulation and policy, pollution control, 
legal and communications, among others. 
2. 
To support the implementation of projects within the different sectors, national and international 
consultants will be hired, if necessary, to implement the identified activities and give support to the NOU 
in liaison with key stakeholders including other Ministries or Agencies, and private sector. 
3. 
Within the foam sector, the consultants will assist in the selection of the more convenient 
technological and economical conversion options.  
4. 
Within the refrigeration sector, they will assist with the implementation of training projects, 
demonstrative conversions, Recovering and Recycling Centre, among other actions to be carried out in 
the refrigeration sector. 
5. 
The Government is fully supportive of the NOU. The Ministry of Environment has ensured -and 
will assure in the future- passage of all necessary national laws and regulations, including establishing an 
import licensing system which allows to establish annual maximum admissible import quantities for Chile 
of substances that are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, its amendments and its annexes and set the 
basis for control of HCFCs into the country. 
6. 
For proper implementation of these projects, it is essential to have the active participation from 
the relevant Public Service Offices as well as the National Customs Service who will have an active 
involvement in defining and implementing procedures for HCFCs control.  
7. 
It is also important to count on the different companies, technicians and technical services 
involved in each activity of this project. These actors will have to take responsibility for implementing 
good practices in refrigeration and promote behavioural change in their peers. Relevant actors within the 
foam sector will include the HCFC-141b users in foams and the suppliers of alternative technologies, as 
well as system houses. 
Verification and Reporting 
 
8. 
The outcome of the different elements of the HPMP will be verified independently by an external 
organization. The Government and the independent organization will jointly design the verification 
procedures as part of the design phase of the monitoring programme. 
Frequency of verification and reporting 
 
9. 
The monitoring reports will be produced each year, previous to the first meeting of the Executive 
Committee. These reports will produce the input for the yearly implementation reports required by the 
Executive Committee.

Annex XII 
 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF GAMBIA (THE) AND THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE REDUCTION IN 
CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of Gambia (the) (the “Country”) 
and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the ozone depleting 
substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 0.98 ODP tonnes by 
1 January 2020 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules.  
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in row 1.2 
of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal Protocol 
reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A.  The Country accepts that, by its 
acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances that exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A as the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances 
specified in Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of each of the Substances that exceeds the 
level defined in row 4.1.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A to 
the Country.  The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this funding at the Executive 
Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country agrees to implement this Agreement in accordance with the HCFC phase-out sector 
plans submitted.  In accordance with sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, the Country will accept 
independent verification of the achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out 
in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A  of this Agreement.  The aforementioned verification will be commissioned 
by the relevant bilateral or implementing agency. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least eight weeks in advance of the 
applicable Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country had met the Targets set out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A for all relevant 
years. Relevant years are all years since the year in which this Agreement was approved.  
Years for which no obligation for reporting of country programme data exists at the date 
of the Executive Committee meeting at which the funding request is being presented are 
exempted;  
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, unless the Executive 
Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted annual implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each previous 
calendar year; that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of activities 
initiated with previously approved tranches; and that the rate of disbursement of funding 
available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent; 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XII 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted an annual implementation plan in the form of 
Appendix 4-A covering each calendar year until and including the year for which the 
funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in case of the final 
tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the Country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol 
HCFC phase-out schedule for the duration of this Agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous annual implementation plans in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in paragraph 4 above. 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
reduction of consumption and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A: 
(a) 
Reallocations categorized as major changes must be documented in advance either in an 
annual implementation plan submitted as foreseen in sub-paragraph 5(d) above, or as a 
revision to an existing annual implementation plan to be submitted eight weeks prior to 
any meeting of the Executive Committee, for its approval. Major changes would relate to: 
(i) 
Issues potentially concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund;  
(ii) 
Changes which would modify any clause of this Agreement;  
(iii) 
Changes in the annual levels of funding allocated to individual bilateral or 
implementing agencies for the different tranches; and 
(iv) 
Provision of funding for programmes or activities not included in the current 
endorsed annual implementation plan, or removal of an activity in the annual 
implementation plan, with a cost greater than 30 per cent of the total cost of the 
last approved tranche; 
(b) 
Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
annual implementation plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the 
Executive Committee in the subsequent annual implementation report; and 
(c) 
Any remaining funds will be returned to the Multilateral Fund upon completion of the 
last tranche foreseen under this Agreement.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XII 
 
 
3 
9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  UNEP has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) and UNIDO has 
agreed to be the cooperating implementing agency (the “Cooperating IA”) under the lead of the Lead IA 
in respect of the Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to evaluations, which 
might be carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral Fund or 
under the evaluation programme of any of the agencies taking part in this Agreement. 
10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for ensuring co-ordinated planning, implementation and 
reporting of all activities under this Agreement, including but not limited to independent verification as 
per sub-paragraph 5(b). This responsibility includes the necessity to co-ordinate with the Cooperating IA 
to ensure appropriate timing and sequence of activities in the implementation. The Cooperating IA will 
support the Lead IA by implementing the activities listed in Appendix 6-B under the overall co-ordination 
of the Lead IA.  The Lead IA and Cooperating IA have reached consensus on the arrangements regarding 
inter-agency planning, reporting and responsibilities under this Agreement to facilitate a co-ordinated 
implementation of the Plan, including regular co-ordination meetings.  The Executive Committee agrees, 
in principle, to provide the Lead IA and the Cooperating IA with the fees set out in rows 2.2 and 2.4 of 
Appendix 2-A. 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule.  The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amount set out in Appendix 7-A (“Reductions in Funding for Failure to 
Comply”) in respect of each ODP kg of reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year.  The 
Executive Committee will discuss each specific case in which the Country did not comply with this 
Agreement, and take related decisions. Once these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an 
impediment for future tranches as per paragraph 5 above. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee, the Lead IA 
and the Cooperating IA to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the 
Lead IA and the Cooperating IA with access to the information necessary to verify compliance with this 
Agreement. 
14. 
The completion of stage I of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end 
of the year following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption level has been 
specified in Appendix 2-A.  Should there at that time still be activities that are outstanding, and which 
were foreseen in the Plan and its subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the 
completion will be delayed until the end of the year following the implementation of the remaining 
activities.  The reporting requirements as per sub-paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 1(d), and 1(e) of Appendix 4-A 
will continue until the time of the completion unless otherwise specified by the Executive Committee. 
15. 
All of the conditions set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement.  All terms used in this Agreement have the 
meaning ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein.

Annex XIII 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF GUINEA-BISSAU AND THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE REDUCTION IN 
CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of Guinea-Bissau (the 
“Country”) and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 
1.84 ODP tonnes by 1 January 2020 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules. 
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in row 1.2 
of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal Protocol 
reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A.  The Country accepts that, by its 
acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances that exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A as the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances 
specified in Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of each of the Substances that exceeds the 
level defined in row 4.1.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A to 
the Country. The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this funding at the Executive 
Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country agrees to implement this Agreement in accordance with the HCFC phase-out sector 
plans submitted. In accordance with sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, the Country will accept 
independent verification of the achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out 
in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A of this Agreement. The aforementioned verification will be commissioned by 
the relevant bilateral or implementing agency. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least eight weeks in advance of the 
applicable Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country had met the Targets set out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A for all relevant 
years. Relevant years are all years since the year in which this Agreement was approved.  
Years for which no obligation for reporting of country programme data exists at the date 
of the Executive Committee meeting at which the funding request is being presented are 
exempted;  
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, unless the Executive 
Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted annual implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each previous 
calendar year; that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of activities 
initiated with previously approved tranches; and that the rate of disbursement of funding 
available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent; 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XIII 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted an annual implementation plan in the form of 
Appendix 4-A covering each calendar year until and including the year for which the 
funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in case of the final 
tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the Country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol 
HCFC phase-out schedule for the duration of this Agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous annual implementation plans in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in paragraph 4 above. 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
reduction of consumption and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A: 
(a) 
Reallocations categorized as major changes must be documented in advance either in an 
annual implementation plan submitted as foreseen in sub-paragraph 5(d) above, or as a 
revision to an existing annual implementation plan to be submitted eight weeks prior to 
any meeting of the Executive Committee, for its approval. Major changes would relate to: 
(i) 
Issues potentially concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund;  
(ii) 
Changes which would modify any clause of this Agreement;  
(iii) 
Changes in the annual levels of funding allocated to individual bilateral or 
implementing agencies for the different tranches; and 
(iv) 
Provision of funding for programmes or activities not included in the current 
endorsed annual implementation plan, or removal of an activity in the annual 
implementation plan, with a cost greater than 30 per cent of the total cost of the 
last approved tranche; 
(b) 
Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
annual implementation plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the 
Executive Committee in the subsequent annual implementation report; 
(c) 
Any remaining funds will be returned to the Multilateral Fund upon completion of the 
last tranche foreseen under this Agreement.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XIII

9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  UNEP has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) and UNIDO has 
agreed to be the cooperating implementing agency (the “Cooperating IA”) under the lead of the Lead IA 
in respect of the Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to evaluations, which 
might be carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral Fund or 
under the evaluation programme of any of the agencies taking part in this Agreement. 
10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for ensuring co-ordinated planning, implementation and 
reporting of all activities under this Agreement, including but not limited to independent verification as 
per sub-paragraph 5(b). This responsibility includes the necessity to co-ordinate with the Cooperating IA 
to ensure appropriate timing and sequence of activities in the implementation. The Cooperating IA will 
support the Lead IA by implementing the activities listed in Appendix 6-B under the overall co-ordination 
of the Lead IA.  The Lead IA and Cooperating IA have reached consensus on the arrangements regarding 
inter-agency planning, reporting and responsibilities under this Agreement to facilitate a co-ordinated 
implementation of the Plan, including regular co-ordination meetings. The Executive Committee agrees, 
in principle, to provide the Lead IA and the Cooperating IA with the fees set out in rows 2.2 and 2.4 of 
Appendix 2-A. 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule.  The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amount set out in Appendix 7-A (“Reductions in Funding for Failure to 
Comply”) in respect of each ODP kg of reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year.  The 
Executive Committee will discuss each specific case in which the Country did not comply with this 
Agreement, and take related decisions. Once these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an 
impediment for future tranches as per paragraph 5 above. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee, the Lead IA 
and the Cooperating IA to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the 
Lead IA and the Cooperating IA with access to the information necessary to verify compliance with this 
Agreement. 
14. 
The completion of stage I of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end 
of the year following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption level has been 
specified in Appendix 2-A.  Should there at that time still be activities that are outstanding, and which 
were foreseen in the Plan and its subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the 
completion will be delayed until the end of the year following the implementation of the remaining 
activities.  The reporting requirements as per sub-paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 1(d), and 1(e) of Appendix 4-A 
will continue until the time of the completion unless otherwise specified by the Executive Committee. 
15. 
All of the conditions set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement.  All terms used in this Agreement have the 
meaning ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein.

Annex XIV 
 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF MONGOLIA AND THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE REDUCTION IN 
CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of Mongolia (the “Country”) 
and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the ozone-depleting 
substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained 0.9 ODP tonnes  prior to 
1 January 2020 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules. 
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal 
Protocol reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A.  The Country accepts that, by 
its acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“maximum allowable total consumption of Annex C, Group I Substances”; the 
Target) as the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances specified in 
Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of each of the Substances which exceeds the level 
defined in row 4.1.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees in principle to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A 
(“Targets and Funding”) to the Country.  The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this 
funding at the Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval 
Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country will accept independent verification, to be commissioned by the relevant bilateral or 
implementing agency, of achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) of this Agreement as described in 
sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least 60 days prior to the applicable 
Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country has met the Targets for all relevant years.  Relevant years are all years 
since the year in which the hydrochlorofluorocarbons phase-out management plan 
(HPMP) was approved.  Exempt are years for which no obligation for reporting of 
country programme data exists at the date of the Executive Committee Meeting at which 
the funding request is being presented; 
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, except if the 
Executive Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted tranche implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each 
previous calendar year, that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of 
activities initiated with previously approved tranches, and that the rate of disbursement of 
funding available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XIV 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted and received approval from the Executive Committee for 
a tranche implementation plan in the form of Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche 
Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each calendar year until and including the 
year for which the funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in 
case of the final tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th Meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol HCFC 
phase-out schedule for the duration of this agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous tranche implementation plan in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in sub-paragraph 5(b). 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
phase-down and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A.  Reallocations categorized as 
major changes must be documented in advance in a Tranche Implementation Plan and approved by the 
Executive Committee as described in sub-paragraph 5(d).  Major changes would relate to reallocations 
affecting in total 30 per cent or more of the funding of the last approved tranche, issues potentially 
concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund, or changes which would modify any clause of 
this Agreement. Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
Tranche Implementation Plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the Executive 
Committee in the Tranche Implementation Report.  Any remaining funds will be returned to the 
Multilateral Fund upon closure of the last tranche of the plan.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  UNEP has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) and the Government 
of Japan has agreed to be the cooperating implementing agency (the “Cooperating IA”) under the lead of 
the Lead IA in respect of the Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to 
evaluations, which might be carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the 
Multilateral Fund or under the evaluation programme of any of the agencies taking part in this 
Agreement. 
10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for carrying out the activities of the plan as detailed in the first 
submission of the HPMP with the changes approved as part of the subsequent tranche submissions, 
including but not limited to independent verification as per sub-paragraph 5(b).  This responsibility 
includes the necessity to co-ordinate with the Cooperating IA to ensure appropriate timing and sequence 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XIV 
 
 
3 
of activities in the implementation. The Cooperating IA will support the Lead IA by implementing the 
activities listed in Appendix 6-B under the overall co-ordination of the Lead IA.  The Lead IA and 
Cooperating IA have entered into a formal agreement regarding planning, reporting and responsibilities 
under this Agreement to facilitate a co-ordinated implementation of the Plan, including regular 
co-ordination meetings.  The Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA and the 
Cooperating IA with the fees set out in rows 2.2 and 2.4 of Appendix 2-A. 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule.  The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amounts set out in Appendix 7-A in respect of each ODP tonne of 
reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The Executive Committee will discuss each 
specific case in which the Country did not comply with this Agreement, and take related decisions. Once 
these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an impediment for future tranches as per 
paragraph 5. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee, the Lead IA 
and the Cooperating IA to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the 
Lead IA and the Cooperating IA with access to information necessary to verify compliance with this 
Agreement. 
14. 
The completion of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end of the year 
following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption has been specified in 
Appendix 2-A. Should at that time activities be still outstanding which were foreseen in the Plan and its 
subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the completion will be delayed until the 
end of the year following the implementation of the remaining activities. The reporting requirements as 
per Appendix 4-A (a), (b), (d) and (e) continue until the time of the completion if not specified by the 
Executive Committee otherwise. 
15. 
All of the agreements set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement have the meaning 
ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein. 
16. 
This updated Agreement supersedes the Agreement reached between the Government of 
Mongolia and the Executive Committee at the 63rd meeting of the Executive Committee.

Annex XVI 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKMENISTAN AND THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE REDUCTION IN 
CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of Turkmenistan (the 
“Country”) and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (the “Substances”) to a sustained level of 
4.42 ODP tonnes prior to 1 January 2020 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules.  
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (the “Targets and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal 
Protocol reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A.  The Country accepts that, by 
its acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (maximum allowable total consumption of Annex C, Group I substances) as the 
final reduction step under this agreement for all ODS specified in Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any 
consumption of each of the substances which exceeds the level defined in row 4.1.3 (remaining eligible 
consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees in principle to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A (the 
“Targets and Funding”) to the Country.  The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this funding 
at the Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (the “Funding Approval Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country will meet the consumption limits for each of the Substances as indicated in 
Appendix 2-A.  It will also accept independent verification to be commissioned by the relevant 
implementing agency (IA) of achievement of these consumption limits as described in sub-paragraph 5(b) 
of this Agreement. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least 60 days prior to the applicable 
Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country has met the Targets for all relevant years. Relevant years are all years 
since the year in which the hydrochlorofluorocarbons phase-out management plan 
(HPMP) was approved.  Exempt are years for which no obligation for reporting of 
country programme data exists at the date of the Executive Committee Meeting at which 
the funding request is being presented; 
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, except if the 
Executive Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted tranche implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (the “Format of Tranche Implementation Report and Plan”) covering each 
previous calendar year, that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of 
activities initiated with previously approved tranches, and that the rate of disbursement of 
funding available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent; and 
 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XVI 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted and received approval from the Executive Committee for 
a tranche implementation plan in the form of Appendix 4-A (the “Format of Tranche 
Implementation Report and Plan”) covering each calendar year until and including the 
year for which the funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in 
case of the final tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (the “Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will 
monitor and report on Implementation of the activities in the previous tranche implementation plan in 
accordance with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be 
subject to independent verification as described in sub-paragraph 5(b). 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the phase down 
and phase out of the Substances specified in n Appendix 1-A. Reallocations categorized as major changes 
must be documented in advance in a Tranche Implementation Plan and approved by the Executive 
Committee as described in sub-paragraph 5(d).  Major changes would relate to reallocations affecting in 
total 30 per cent or more of the funding of the last approved tranche, issues potentially concerning the 
rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund, or changes which would modify any clause of this Agreement. 
Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved tranche 
implementation plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the Executive Committee in the 
tranche implementation report.  Any remaining funds will be returned to the Multilateral Fund upon 
closure of the last tranche of the plan.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular that: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and

The Country and the implementing agencies involved will take full account of the 
requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  UNIDO has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”).  The Country 
agrees to evaluations, which might be carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes 
of the Multilateral Fund or under the evaluation programme of any of the IA taking part in this 
Agreement. 
10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for carrying out the activities of the plan as detailed in the first 
submission of the HPMP with the changes approved as part of the subsequent tranche submissions, 
including but not limited to independent verification as per sub-paragraph 5(b).  The Executive 
Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA with the fees set out in row 2.2 of Appendix 2-A. 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised funding 
approval schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule.  The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64

the amount of the Funding by the amounts set out in Appendix 7-A in respect of each ODP tonne of 
reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The Executive Committee will discuss each 
specific case in which the country did not comply with this agreement, and take related decisions. Once 
these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an impediment for future tranches as per 
paragraph 5. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee, the Lead IA 
to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the Lead IA with access to 
information necessary to verify compliance with this Agreement. 
14. 
The completion of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end of the year 
following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption has been specified in 
Appendix 2-A. Should at that time activities be still outstanding which were foreseen in the plan and its 
subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and 7, the completion will be delayed until the end of the 
year following the implementation of the remaining activities. The reporting requirements as per 
Appendix 4-A (a), (b), (d) and (e) continue until the time of the completion if not specified by the 
Executive Committee otherwise. 
15. 
All of the agreements set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement have the meaning 
ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein. 
16.

Annex XVII 
 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE REDUCTION IN 
CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of Zimbabwe (the “Country”) 
and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the ozone-depleting 
substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 11.57 ODP tonnes 
prior by 1 January 2020 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules. 
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in row 1.2 
of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal Protocol 
reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A. The Country accepts that, by its 
acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances that exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A as the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances 
specified in Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of each of the Substances that exceeds the 
level defined in rows 4.1.3, 4.2.3 and 4.3.3. 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A to 
the Country. The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this funding at the Executive 
Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (Funding Approval Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country agrees to implement this Agreement in accordance with the HCFC phase-out sector 
plans submitted. In accordance with sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, the Country will accept 
independent verification of the achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out 
in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A. of this Agreement. The aforementioned verification will be commissioned 
by the relevant bilateral or implementing agency 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least eight weeks in advance of the 
applicable Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country had met the Targets set out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A for all relevant 
years. Relevant years are all years since the year in which this Agreement was approved. 
Years for which no obligation for reporting of country programme data exists at the date 
of the Executive Committee meeting at which the funding request is being presented are 
exempted;  
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, unless the Executive 
Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted annual implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each previous 
calendar year; that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of activities 
initiated with previously approved tranches; and that the rate of disbursement of funding 
available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent; 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XVII 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted an annual implementation plan in the form of 
Appendix 4-A covering each calendar year until and including the year for which the 
funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in case of the final 
tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the Country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol 
HCFC phase-out schedule for the duration of this Agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement. The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous annual implementation plans in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A. This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in paragraph 4 above. 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
reduction of consumption and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A: 
(a) 
Reallocations categorized as major changes must be documented in advance either in an 
annual implementation plan submitted as foreseen in sub-paragraph 5(d) above, or as a 
revision to an existing annual implementation plan to be submitted eight weeks prior to 
any meeting of the Executive Committee, for its approval. Major changes would relate to: 
(i) 
Issues potentially concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund;  
(ii) 
Changes which would modify any clause of this Agreement;  
(iii) 
Changes in the annual levels of funding allocated to individual bilateral or 
implementing agencies for the different tranches; and 
(iv) 
Provision of funding for programmes or activities not included in the current 
endorsed annual implementation plan, or removal of an activity in the annual 
implementation plan, with a cost greater than 30 per cent of the total cost of the 
last approved tranche; 
(b) 
Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
annual implementation plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the 
Executive Committee in the subsequent annual implementation report; 
(c) 
Should the Country decide during implementation of the agreement to introduce an 
alternative technology other than that proposed in the approved HPMP, this would 
require approval by the Executive Committee as part of an Annual Implementation Plan 
or the revision of the approved plan. Any submission of such a request for change in 
technology would identify the associated incremental costs, the potential impact to the 
climate, and any differences in ODP tonnes to be phased out if applicable. The Country 
agrees that potential savings in incremental costs related to the change of technology 
would decrease the overall funding level under this Agreement accordingly;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XVII 
 
 
3 
(d) 
Any remaining funds will be returned to the Multilateral Fund upon completion of the 
last tranche foreseen under this Agreement. 
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement. Germany has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) in respect of the 
Country’s activities under this Agreement. The Country agrees to evaluations, which might be carried out 
under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral Fund or under the evaluation 
programme of any of the agencies taking part in this Agreement. 
10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for ensuring co-ordinated planning, implementation and 
reporting of all activities under this Agreement, including but not limited to independent verification as 
per sub-paragraph 5(b). The Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA with the 
fees set out in row 3.2 of Appendix 2-A. 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule. At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule. The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amount set out in Appendix 7-A (“Reductions in Funding for Failure to 
Comply”) in respect of each ODP kg of reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The 
Executive Committee will discuss each specific case in which the Country did not comply with this 
Agreement, and take related decisions. Once these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an 
impediment for future tranches as per paragraph 5 above. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee, the Lead IA 
to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the Lead IA with access to the 
information necessary to verify compliance with this Agreement. 
14. 
The completion of stage I of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end 
of the year following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption level has been 
specified in Appendix 2-A. Should there at that time still be activities that are outstanding, and which 
were foreseen in the Plan and its subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the 
completion will be delayed until the end of the year following the implementation of the remaining 
activities. The reporting requirements as per sub-paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 1(d), and 1(e) of Appendix 4-A 
will continue until the time of the completion unless otherwise specified by the Executive Committee.

VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON RENEWAL OF 
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING PROJECTS SUBMITTED TO THE 71st MEETING 
Argentina 
1. 
The Executive Committee reviewed the report presented for the institutional strengthening project 
renewal request for Argentina and noted with appreciation that the country has taken the necessary steps 
to sustain the CFCs phase-out achieved and to meet the targets of the Montreal Protocol related to the 
HCFCs.  The Executive Committee commends the Government of Argentina for strengthening its legal 
framework to control the ODS import/export, implementing a quota system for HCFC and banning some 
of their uses, promoting low-global warming potential alternatives to HCFCs within the national industry 
and working with several government and private entities to coordinate efforts and actions aiming to 
comply with Argentina’s commitments with the Montreal Protocol. The Executive Committee is therefore 
hopeful that Argentina will continue to implement the ODS phase-out activities with outstanding success 
in order to achieve compliance with the 2013 and 2015 HCFC control targets. 
Bangladesh 
2. 
The Executive Committee reviewed the report presented with the institutional strengthening 
request for Bangladesh and noted with appreciation that the country has taken significant steps to 
complete implementation of the national ODS phase-out plan and CFC metered-dose inhaler (MDI) 
phase-out project. The Executive Committee also noted that the Government of Bangladesh successfully 
carried out conversion of all CFC-based MDI formulations to CFC-free formulations and placed 
CFC-free MDIs in the market in 2013. The Executive Committee is therefore hopeful that, in the next two 
years, Bangladesh will continue to strengthen capacity to monitor and control ODS, sustain the progress 
achieved and build upon the experience of CFC reduction, in order to meet the 2013 and 2015 control 
targets for HCFC consumption. 
Benin 
3. 
The Executive Committee reviewed the report of the institutional strengthening project renewal 
request for Benin and noted with appreciation that the country reported Article 7 data to the Ozone 
Secretariat indicating that it is on track to meet the compliance targets of the Montreal Protocol. The 
Executive Committee is therefore optimistic that Benin will continue the implementation of its HCFC 
phase-out management plan with outstanding success in order to meet the initial targets to freeze and 
reduce the consumption of HCFCs in 2013 and 2015, respectively. 
Bhutan 
4. 
The Executive Committee reviewed the report of the institutional strengthening project renewal 
request for Bhutan and noted with appreciation that the country reported Article 7 data to the Ozone 
Secretariat indicating that it is in compliance with the Montreal Protocol control measures. The Executive 
Committee is therefore hopeful that Bhutan will continue the implementation of its HCFC phase-out 
management plan with outstanding success in order to meet the initial targets to freeze and reduce the 
consumption of HCFCs in 2013 and 2015, respectively.

UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA AND THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE REDUCTION IN 
CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of India (the “Country”) and the 
Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the ozone-depleting substances 
(ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 1,447.38 ODP tonnes by 
1 January 2015 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules. 
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in row 1.2 
of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal Protocol 
reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A. The Country accepts that, by its 
acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances that exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A as the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances 
specified in Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of each of the Substances that exceeds the 
level defined in rows 4.1.3, 4.2.3, 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.5.3 and 4.6.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A to 
the Country. The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this funding at the Executive 
Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country agrees to implement this Agreement in accordance with the HCFC phase-out sector 
plans submitted. In accordance with sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement, the Country will accept 
independent verification of the achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out 
in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A of this Agreement. The aforementioned verification will be commissioned by 
the relevant bilateral or implementing agency. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least eight weeks in advance of the 
applicable Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country had met the Targets set out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A for all relevant 
years. Relevant years are all years since the year in which this Agreement was approved. 
Years for which no obligation for reporting of country programme data exists at the date 
of the Executive Committee meeting at which the funding request is being presented are 
exempted; 
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, unless the Executive 
Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted annual implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each previous 
calendar year; that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of activities 
initiated with previously approved tranches; and that the rate of disbursement of funding 
available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent; 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XX 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted an annual implementation plan in the form of 
Appendix 4-A covering each calendar year until and including the year for which the 
funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in case of the final 
tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the Country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol 
HCFC phase-out schedule for the duration of this Agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement. The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous annual implementation plans in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A. This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in paragraph 4 above. 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
reduction of consumption and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A: 
(a) 
Reallocations categorized as major changes must be documented in advance either in an 
annual implementation plan submitted as foreseen in sub-paragraph 5(d) above, or as a 
revision to an existing annual implementation plan to be submitted eight weeks prior to 
any meeting of the Executive Committee, for its approval. Major changes would relate to: 
(i) 
Issues potentially concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund;  
(ii) 
Changes which would modify any clause of this Agreement;  
(iii) 
Changes in the annual levels of funding allocated to individual bilateral or 
implementing agencies for the different tranches; and 
(iv) 
Provision of funding for programmes or activities not included in the current 
endorsed annual implementation plan, or removal of an activity in the annual 
implementation plan, with a cost greater than 30 per cent of the total cost of the 
last approved tranche; 
(b) 
Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
annual implementation plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the 
Executive Committee in the subsequent annual implementation report; 
(c) 
Should the Country decide during implementation of the agreement to introduce an 
alternative technology other than that proposed in the approved HPMP, this would 
require approval by the Executive Committee as part of an Annual Implementation Plan 
or the revision of the approved plan. Any submission of such a request for change in 
technology would identify the associated incremental costs, the potential impact to the 
climate, and any differences in ODP tonnes to be phased out if applicable. The Country 
agrees that potential savings in incremental costs related to the change of technology 
would decrease the overall funding level under this Agreement accordingly;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XX 
 
 
3 
(d) 
Any enterprise to be converted to non-HCFC technology included in the approved HPMP 
and that would be found to be ineligible under the guidelines of the Multilateral Fund 
(i.e., due to foreign ownership or establishment post the 21 September 2007 cut-off date), 
will not receive assistance. This information would be reported to the Executive 
Committee as part of the Annual Implementation Plan; 
(e) 
The Country commits to examining the possibility of using pre-blended hydrocarbon 
systems instead of blending them in-house, for those foam enterprises covered under the 
umbrella project, should this be technically viable, economically feasible and acceptable 
to the enterprises; 
(f) 
Any remaining funds will be returned to the Multilateral Fund upon completion of the 
last tranche foreseen under this Agreement.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement. UNDP has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) and UNEP and 
Government of Germany have agreed to be the cooperating implementing agencies (the “Cooperating 
IAs”) under the lead of the Lead IA in respect of the Country’s activities under this Agreement. The 
Country agrees to evaluations, which might be carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work 
programmes of the Multilateral Fund or under the evaluation programme of any of the agencies taking 
part in this Agreement. 
10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for ensuring co-ordinated planning, implementation and 
reporting of all activities under this Agreement, including but not limited to independent verification as 
per sub-paragraph 5(b). This responsibility includes the necessity to co-ordinate with the Cooperating IAs 
to ensure appropriate timing and sequence of activities in the implementation. The Cooperating IAs will 
support the Lead IA by implementing the activities listed in Appendix 6-B under the overall co-ordination 
of the Lead IA. The Lead IA and Cooperating IAs have reached consensus on the arrangements regarding 
inter-agency planning, reporting and responsibilities under this Agreement to facilitate a co-ordinated 
implementation of the Plan, including regular coordination meetings. The Executive Committee agrees, in 
principle, to provide the Lead IA and the Cooperating IAs with the fees set out in rows 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 of 
Appendix 2-A. 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule. At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule. The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amount set out in Appendix 7-A (“Reductions in Funding for Failure to 
Comply”) in respect of each ODP kg of reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XX 
 
 
4 
Executive Committee will discuss each specific case in which the Country did not comply with this 
Agreement, and take related decisions. Once these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an 
impediment for future tranches as per paragraph 5 above. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee, the Lead IA 
and the Cooperating IAs to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the 
Lead IA and the Cooperating IAs with access to the information necessary to verify compliance with this 
Agreement. 
14. 
The completion of stage I of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end 
of the year following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption level has been 
specified in Appendix 2-A. Should there at that time still be activities that are outstanding, and which 
were foreseen in the Plan and its subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the 
completion will be delayed until the end of the year following the implementation of the remaining 
activities. The reporting requirements as per sub-paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 1(d), and 1(e) of Appendix 4-A 
will continue until the time of the completion unless otherwise specified by the Executive Committee. 
15. 
All of the conditions set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement have the meaning 
ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein.  
16. 
This updated Agreement supersedes the Agreement reached between the Government of India 
and the Executive Committee at the 66th meeting of the Executive Committee.

Annex XXI 
 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA AND 
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE REDUCTION 
IN CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding between the Government of Indonesia (the 
“Country”) and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 
323.1 ODP tonnes prior to 1 January 2018 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules.  
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal 
Protocol reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A . The Country accepts that, by 
its acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (maximum allowable total consumption of Annex-C, Group I substances) as the 
final reduction step under this agreement for all of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A, and in 
respect to any consumption of each of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in rows 4.1.3, 
4.2.3, 4.3.3 and 4.4.3. 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees in principle to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A (the 
“Targets and Funding”) to the Country. The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this funding 
at the Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (the “Funding Approval Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country will accept independent verification, to be commissioned by the relevant bilateral or 
implementing agency, of achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) of this Agreement as described in 
sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least 60 days prior to the applicable 
Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country has met the Targets for all relevant years. Relevant years are all years 
since the year in which the hydrochlorofluorocarbons phase-out management plan 
(HPMP) was approved. Exempt are years for which no obligation for reporting of country 
programme data exists at the date of the Executive Committee Meeting at which the 
funding request is being presented; 
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, except if the 
Executive Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted tranche implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (the “Format of Tranche Implementation Report and Plan”) covering each 
previous calendar year, that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of 
activities initiated with previously approved tranches, and that the rate of disbursement of 
funding available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXI 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted and received approval from the Executive Committee for 
a tranche implementation plan in the form of Appendix 4-A (the “Format of Tranche 
Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each calendar year until and including the 
year for which the funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in 
case of the final tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th Meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the Country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol 
HCFC phase-out schedule for the duration of this Agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement. The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (the “Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will 
monitor and report on Implementation of the activities in the previous tranche implementation plan in 
accordance with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A. This monitoring will also be 
subject to independent verification as described in sub-paragraph 5(b). 
7. 
The Country agrees, in cases where HFC technologies have been chosen as an alternative HCFC, 
and taking into account national circumstances related to health and safety:  
(a) 
To monitor the availability of substitutes and alternatives that further minimize impacts 
on the climate; 
(b) 
To consider, in the review of regulations standards and incentives adequate provisions 
that encourage introduction of such alternatives; and 
(c) 
To consider the potential for adoption of cost-effective alternatives that minimize the 
climate impact in the implementation of the HPMP, as appropriate, and inform the 
Executive Committee on the progress accordingly. 
8. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
reduction of consumption and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A.   
(a) 
Reallocations categorized as major changes must be documented in advance in an annual 
implementation plan and approved by the Executive Committee as described in 
sub-paragraph 5(d) above.  Major changes would relate to issues potentially concerning 
the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund; changes which would modify any clause 
of this Agreement; changes in the annual levels of funding allocated to individual 
bilateral or implementing agencies for the different tranches; and provision of funding for 
programmes or activities not included in the current endorsed annual implementation 
plan, or removal of an activity in the annual implementation plan, with a cost greater than 
30 per cent of the total cost of the tranche;  
(b) 
Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
annual implementation plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the 
Executive Committee in the annual implementation report;  
(c) 
Should the Country decide during implementation of the agreement to introduce an 
alternative technology other than that proposed in the approved HPMP, this would 
require approval by the Executive Committee as part of an Annual Implementation Plan 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXI 
 
 
3 
or the revision of the approved plan. Any submission of such a request for change in 
technology would identify the associated incremental costs, the potential impact to the 
climate, and any differences in ODP tonnes to be phased out if applicable. The Country 
agrees that potential savings in incremental costs related to the change of technology 
would decrease the overall funding level under this Agreement accordingly; and 
(d) 
Any remaining funds will be returned to the Multilateral Fund.  
9. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
10. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement. UNDP has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) and the Government 
of Australia, UNIDO and the World Bank have agreed to be the cooperating agencies under the lead of 
the Lead IA in respect of the Country’s activities under this Agreement. The Country agrees to 
evaluations, which might be carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the 
Multilateral Fund or under the evaluation programme of any of the IA taking part in this Agreement. 
11. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for carrying out the activities of the plan as detailed in the first 
submission of the HPMP with the changes approved as part of the subsequent tranche submissions, 
including but not limited to independent verification as per sub-paragraph 5(b). This responsibility 
includes the necessity to co-ordinate with the cooperating agencies to ensure appropriate timing and 
sequence of activities in the implementation. The cooperating agencies will support the Lead IA by 
implementing the activities listed in Appendix 6-B under the overall co-ordination of the Lead IA. The 
Lead IA and cooperating agencies have entered into a formal agreement regarding planning, reporting and 
responsibilities under this Agreement to facilitate a co-ordinated implementation of the Plan, including 
regular coordination meetings. The Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA and 
the cooperating agencies with the fees set out in rows 2.2, 2.4, 2.6 and 2.8 of Appendix 2-A. 
12. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule. At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule. The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amounts set out in Appendix 7-A in respect of each ODP tonne of 
reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The Executive Committee will discuss each 
specific case in which the country did not comply with this Agreement, and take related decisions. Once 
these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an impediment for future tranches as per 
paragraph 5. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXI 
 
 
4 
13. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
14. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee, the Lead IA 
and the cooperating agencies to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide 
the Lead IA and the cooperating agencies with access to information necessary to verify compliance with 
this Agreement. 
15. 
The completion of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end of the year 
following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption has been specified in 
Appendix 2-A. Should at that time activities be still outstanding which were foreseen in the Plan and its 
subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 8, the completion will be delayed until the 
end of the year following the implementation of the remaining activities. The reporting requirements as 
per Appendix 4-A (a), (b), (d) and (e) continue until the time of the completion if not specified by the 
Executive Committee otherwise. 
16. 
All of the agreements set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement have the meaning 
ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein. 
17. 
This updated Agreement supersedes the Agreement reached between the Government of 
Indonesia and the Executive Committee at the 64th meeting of the Executive Committee.

Annex XXII 
 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF MONTENEGRO AND THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE REDUCTION IN 
CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of Montenegro (the “Country”) 
and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the ozone-depleting 
substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 0.52 ODP tonnes  
prior to 1 January 2020 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules. 
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal 
Protocol reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A.  The Country accepts that, by 
its acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“maximum allowable total consumption of Annex C, Group I Substances”; the 
Target) as the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances specified in 
Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of each of the Substances which exceeds the level 
defined in row 4.1.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees in principle to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A 
(“Targets and Funding”) to the Country.  The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this 
funding at the Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval 
Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country will accept independent verification, to be commissioned by the relevant 
implementing agency (IA), of achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out 
in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) of this Agreement as described in 
sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least 60 days prior to the applicable 
Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country has met the Targets for all relevant years.  Relevant years are all years 
since the year in which the hydrochlorofluorocarbons phase-out management plan 
(HPMP) was approved.  Exempt are years for which no obligation for reporting of 
country programme data exists at the date of the Executive Committee Meeting at which 
the funding request is being presented; 
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, except if the 
Executive Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXII 
 
 
2 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted tranche implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each 
previous calendar year, that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of 
activities initiated with previously approved tranches, and that the rate of disbursement of 
funding available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent; 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted and received approval from the Executive Committee for 
a tranche implementation plan in the form of Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche 
Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each calendar year until and including the 
year for which the funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in 
case of the final tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th Meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol HCFC 
phase-out schedule for the duration of this agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous tranche implementation plan in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in sub-paragraph 5(b). 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
phase-down and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A.  Reallocations categorized as 
major changes must be documented in advance in a Tranche Implementation Plan and approved by the 
Executive Committee as described in sub-paragraph 5(d).  Major changes would relate to reallocations 
affecting in total 30 per cent or more of the funding of the last approved tranche, issues potentially 
concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund, or changes which would modify any clause of 
this Agreement. Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
Tranche Implementation Plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the Executive 
Committee in the Tranche Implementation Report.  Any remaining funds will be returned to the 
Multilateral Fund upon closure of the last tranche of the plan.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan.

The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  UNIDO has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) in respect of the 
Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to evaluations, which might be carried out 
under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral Fund or under the evaluation 
programme of any of the agencies taking part in this Agreement.

10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for carrying out the activities of the plan as detailed in the first 
submission of the HPMP with the changes approved as part of the subsequent tranche submissions, 
including but not limited to independent verification as per sub-paragraph 5(b).  The Executive 
Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA with the fees set out in row 2.2 of Appendix 2-A. 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule.  The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amounts set out in Appendix 7-A in respect of each ODP tonne of 
reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The Executive Committee will discuss each 
specific case in which the Country did not comply with this Agreement, and take related decisions. Once 
these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an impediment for future tranches as per 
paragraph 5. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee and the Lead 
IA to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the Lead IA with access to 
information necessary to verify compliance with this Agreement. 
14. 
The completion of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end of the year 
following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption has been specified in 
Appendix 2-A. Should at that time activities be still outstanding which were foreseen in the Plan and its 
subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the completion will be delayed until the 
end of the year following the implementation of the remaining activities. The reporting requirements as 
per Appendix 4-A (a), (b), (d) and (e) continue until the time of the completion if not specified by the 
Executive Committee otherwise. 
15. 
All of the agreements set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement have the meaning 
ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein. 
16. 
This updated Agreement supersedes the Agreement reached between the Government of 
Montenegro and the Executive Committee at the 63rd meeting of the Executive Committee.

Annex XXIII 
 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NAMIBIA  
AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND  
FOR THE PHASE-OUT OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of Namibia (the “Country”) and 
the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the ozone-depleting substances 
(ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 0.21 ODP tonnes prior to 
1 January 2025 and zero ODP tonne prior to 1 January 2030 in compliance with agreed Montreal Protocol 
schedules. 
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal 
Protocol reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A.  The Country accepts that, by 
its acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“maximum allowable total consumption of Annex C, Group I Substances”; the 
Target) as the final reduction step under this Agreement for all of the Substances specified in 
Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of each of the Substances which exceeds the level 
defined in rows 4.1.3 and 4.2.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees in principle to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A 
(“Targets and Funding”) to the Country.  The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this 
funding at the Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval 
Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country will accept independent verification, to be commissioned by the relevant bilateral or 
implementing agency, of achievement of the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, and Funding”) of this Agreement as described in 
sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least 60 days prior to the applicable 
Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country has met the Targets for all relevant years.  Relevant years are all years 
since the year in which the hydrochlorofluorocarbons phase-out management plan 
(HPMP) was approved.  Exempt are years for which no obligation for reporting of 
country programme data exists at the date of the Executive Committee Meeting at which 
the funding request is being presented; 
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, except if the 
Executive Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted tranche implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each 
previous calendar year, that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of 
activities initiated with previously approved tranches, and that the rate of disbursement of 
funding available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXIII 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted and received approval from the Executive Committee for 
a tranche implementation plan in the form of Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche 
Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each calendar year until and including the 
year for which the funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in 
case of the final tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th Meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol HCFC 
phase-out schedule for the duration of this agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous tranche implementation plan in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in sub-paragraph 5(b). 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
phase-down and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A.  Reallocations categorized as 
major changes must be documented in advance in a Tranche Implementation Plan and approved by the 
Executive Committee as described in sub-paragraph 5(d).  Major changes would relate to reallocations 
affecting in total 30 per cent or more of the funding of the last approved tranche, issues potentially 
concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund, or changes which would modify any clause of 
this Agreement. Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
Tranche Implementation Plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the Executive 
Committee in the Tranche Implementation Report.  Any remaining funds will be returned to the 
Multilateral Fund upon closure of the last tranche of the plan.  
8. 
Specific attention will be paid to the execution of the activities in the refrigeration servicing 
sub-sector, in particular: 
(a) 
The Country would use the flexibility available under this Agreement to address specific 
needs that might arise during project implementation; and 
(b) 
The Country and the bilateral and implementing agencies involved will take full account 
of the requirements of decisions 41/100 and 49/6 during the implementation of the plan. 
9. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  The Government of Germany has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead 
IA”) in respect of the Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to evaluations, 
which might be carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral 
Fund or under the evaluation programme of any of the agencies taking part in this Agreement. 
10. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for carrying out the activities of the plan as detailed in the first 
submission of the HPMP with the changes approved as part of the subsequent tranche submissions, 
including but not limited to independent verification as per sub-paragraph 5(b). The Executive Committee 
agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA with the fees set out in row 2.2 of Appendix 2-A. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXIII 
 
 
3 
11. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule.  The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amounts set out in Appendix 7-A in respect of each ODP tonne of 
reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The Executive Committee will discuss each 
specific case in which the Country did not comply with this Agreement, and take related decisions. Once 
these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an impediment for future tranches as per 
paragraph 5. 
12. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
13. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee and the Lead 
IA to facilitate implementation of this Agreement.  In particular, it will provide the Lead IA with access to 
information necessary to verify compliance with this Agreement. 
14. 
The completion of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end of the year 
following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption has been specified in 
Appendix 2-A. Should at that time activities be still outstanding which were foreseen in the Plan and its 
subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the completion will be delayed until the 
end of the year following the implementation of the remaining activities. The reporting requirements as 
per Appendix 4-A (a), (b), (d) and (e) continue until the time of the completion if not specified by the 
Executive Committee otherwise. 
15. 
All of the agreements set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement have the meaning 
ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein. 
16. 
This updated Agreement supersedes the Agreement reached between the Government of Namibia 
and the Executive Committee at the 63rd meeting of the Executive Committee.

Annex XXIV 
 
UPDATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF VIET NAM AND THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE  
REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of Viet Nam (the “Country”) 
and the Executive Committee with respect to the reduction of controlled use of the ozone-depleting 
substances (ODS) set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to a sustained level of 100 per cent of the 
baseline consumption level and 90 per cent of the baseline consumption level by 1 January 2013 and 
1 January 2015, respectively.  In this context, the baseline consumption level is defined as the average 
consumption level of Annex C, Group I chemicals in 2009 and 2010.   
2. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual consumption limits of the Substances as set out in row 1.2 
of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets and Funding”) in this Agreement as well as in the Montreal Protocol 
reduction schedule for all Substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A . The Country accepts that, by its 
acceptance of this Agreement and performance by the Executive Committee of its funding obligations 
described in paragraph 3, it is precluded from applying for or receiving further funding from the 
Multilateral Fund in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceeds the level defined in 
row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A (“maximum allowable total consumption of Annex C, Group I Substances”; the 
Target) as the final reduction step under this agreement for all of the Substances specified in 
Appendix 1-A, and in respect to any consumption of the Substances which exceed the level defined in 
rows 4.1.3, 4.2.3, 4.3.3 and 4.4.3 (remaining eligible consumption). 
3. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees in principle to provide the funding set out in row 2.1 of Appendix 2-A 
(“Targets and Funding”) to the Country. The Executive Committee will, in principle, provide this funding 
at the Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval Schedule”). 
4. 
The Country will meet the consumption limit as indicated in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A. It will 
also accept independent verification, to be commissioned by the relevant bilateral or implementing 
agency, of achievement of this consumption limit as described in sub-paragraph 5(b) of this Agreement. 
5. 
The Executive Committee will not provide the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval 
Schedule unless the Country satisfies the following conditions at least 60 days prior to the applicable 
Executive Committee meeting set out in the Funding Approval Schedule: 
(a) 
That the Country has met the Targets for all relevant years. Relevant years are all years 
since the year in which the hydrochlorofluorocarbons phase-out management plan 
(HPMP) was approved. Exempt are years for which no obligation for reporting of country 
programme data exists at the date of the Executive Committee Meeting at which the 
funding request is being presented; 
(b) 
That the meeting of these Targets has been independently verified, except if the 
Executive Committee decided that such verification would not be required; 
(c) 
That the Country had submitted tranche implementation reports in the form of 
Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche Implementation Report and Plan”) covering each 
previous calendar year, that it had achieved a significant level of implementation of 
activities initiated with previously approved tranches, and that the rate of disbursement of 
funding available from the previously approved tranche was more than 20 per cent;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXIV 
 
 
2 
(d) 
That the Country has submitted and received approval from the Executive Committee for 
a tranche implementation plan in the form of Appendix 4-A (“Format of Tranche 
Implementation Reports and Plans”) covering each calendar year until and including the 
year for which the funding schedule foresees the submission of the next tranche or, in 
case of the final tranche, until completion of all activities foreseen; and 
(e) 
That, for all submissions from the 68th Meeting onwards, confirmation has been received 
from the Government that an enforceable national system of licensing and quotas for 
HCFC imports and, where applicable, production and exports is in place and that the 
system is capable of ensuring the country's compliance with the Montreal Protocol HCFC 
phase-out schedule for the duration of this agreement. 
6. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement. The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous tranche implementation plan in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A. This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification as described in sub-paragraph 5(b). 
7. 
The Executive Committee agrees that the Country may have the flexibility to reallocate the 
approved funds, or part of the funds, according to the evolving circumstances to achieve the smoothest 
phase-down and phase-out of the Substances specified in Appendix 1-A. Reallocations categorized as 
major changes must be documented in advance in a Tranche Implementation Plan and approved by the 
Executive Committee as described in sub-paragraph 5(d). Major changes would relate to reallocations 
affecting in total 30 per cent or more of the funding of the last approved tranche, issues potentially 
concerning the rules and policies of the Multilateral Fund, or changes which would modify any clause of 
this Agreement. Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated in the approved 
Tranche Implementation Plan, under implementation at the time, and reported to the Executive 
Committee in the Tranche Implementation Report. Any remaining funds will be returned to the 
Multilateral Fund upon closure of the last tranche of the plan. 
8. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  The World Bank has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) in respect 
of the Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to evaluations, which might be 
carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral Fund or under the 
evaluation programme of the Lead IA. 
9. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for carrying out the activities of the plan as detailed in the first 
submission of the HPMP with the changes approved as part of the subsequent tranche submissions, 
including but not limited to independent verification as per sub-paragraph 5(b).  The Executive 
Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA with the fees set out in row 2.2 of Appendix 2-A. 
10. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the Targets for the elimination of the Substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise does not comply with this Agreement, then the Country 
agrees that it will not be entitled to the Funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule. At 
the discretion of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding 
Approval Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied all of its obligations that were due to be met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under 
the Funding Approval Schedule. The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce 
the amount of the Funding by the amounts set out in Appendix 7-A in respect of each ODP kilogramme 
(kg) of reductions in consumption not achieved in any one year. The Executive Committee will discuss 
each specific case in which the Country did not comply with this Agreement, and take related decisions. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXIV 
 
 
3 
Once these decisions are taken, this specific case will not be an impediment for future tranches as per 
paragraph 5. 
11. 
The Funding of this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other consumption sector projects or any other 
related activities in the Country. 
12. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request of the Executive Committee and the Lead 
IA to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the Lead IA with access to 
information necessary to verify compliance with this Agreement. 
13. 
The completion of the HPMP and the associated Agreement will take place at the end of the year 
following the last year for which a maximum allowable total consumption has been specified in 
Appendix 2-A. Should at that time activities be still outstanding which were foreseen in the Plan and its 
subsequent revisions as per sub-paragraph 5(d) and paragraph 7, the completion will be delayed until the 
end of the year following the implementation of the remaining activities. The reporting requirements as 
per Appendix 4-A (a), (b), (d) and (e) continue until the time of the completion if not specified by the 
Executive Committee otherwise. 
14. 
All of the agreements set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement. All terms used in this Agreement have the meaning 
ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein. 
15. 
This updated Agreement supersedes the Agreement reached between the Government of 
Viet Nam and the Executive Committee at the 63rd meeting of the Executive Committee.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE  
OF THE MULTILATERAL FUND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MONTREAL 
PROTOCOL AND THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA FOR THE PHASE-OUT OF 
PRODUCTION OF HYDROCHLOROFLUOROCARBONS REQUIRED BY THE MONTREAL 
PROTOCOL 
 
1. 
This Agreement represents the understanding of the Government of China (the “Country”) and 
the 
Executive 
Committee 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
total 
phase-out 
of 
production 
of 
the 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) for controlled uses, as set out in Appendix 1-A (“The Substances”) to 
this Agreement, and the freeze and 10 per cent baseline reduction foreseen for stage I of the HCFC 
Production Sector Phase-out Management Plan (HPPMP).   
Framework agreement for total phase-out 
 
2. 
The total compensation for the entire China HCFC production sector for phasing out HCFC 
production for controlled uses in accordance with the Montreal Protocol phase-out schedule shall not 
exceed US $385 million, inclusive of all project costs, excluding agency fees, with the allocation of 
payments beyond Stage I to be addressed in future stages.   
3. 
The total amount of phase-out to be achieved under the HPPMP is 445,888 metric tonnes (MT), 
based on the verified 2010 ODS production data of: 310,000 MT of HCFC-22, 98,711 MT of 
HCFC-141b, 33,957 MT of HCFC-142b, 2,819 MT of HCFC-123 and 401 MT of HCFC-124. 
4. 
Appendix 1-A to this Agreement establishes a starting point for aggregate reduction in HCFC 
production eligible for funding of 30,180 ODP tonnes (445,888 MT).   
5. 
The Country agrees that funding for Stage I and beyond should be used to prioritize total 
permanent closure and dismantling of production lines. 
6. 
The Country agrees: 
(a) 
To retire an additional 24 per cent of the production capacity that was established as of 
2010 beyond the total tonnage of 445,888 MT as mentioned in paragraph 3 above (i.e., 
552,901 MT) to take into account average utilization of HCFC production capacity;   
(b) 
The 552,901 MT includes all production lines based on the list of HCFC production 
plants, as specified in the addendum to the HPPMP referred to in paragraph 1 of 
Appendix 4-A of this Agreement, namely: (i) those production lines producing HCFCs 
for controlled uses that will be closed and dismantled; (ii) other production lines 
producing for both controlled uses and feedstock that will be retired as needed to achieve 
the target in paragraph 6(a); and  
(c) 
Capacity closure and retirement strategies are to be further defined, monitored and 
updated in future tranche implementation work plans and progress reports.   
7. 
The Country agrees to ensure that any funds in the possession of the Foreign Economic 
Cooperation Office/Ministry of the Environment (FECO/MEP) will return a reasonable rate of interest 
and that any interest will be offset in future tranches with the reporting requirements of FECO/MEP and 
the World Bank pursuant to decision 70/20(c) on the reporting on disbursement.  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXVI

8. 
The Country will not provide funding in Stage I or beyond for the production line which 
produced CFCs in Zhejiang Juhua Fluoro-chemical Co. Ltd. in 2010.  
9. 
The Country agrees to ensure that any compensated plant does not redirect any phased out HCFC 
production capacity toward feedstock, subject to a penalty to be specified in the agreement for each stage 
of the HPPMP. 
10. 
The Country agrees to coordinate with its stakeholders and authorities to make best efforts to 
manage HCFC production and associated by-product production in HCFC plants in accordance with best 
practices to minimize associated climate impacts. The budget and activities for such coordination will be 
included in the tranche implementation work plan and progress report.  
11. 
The Country agrees to optimize the implementation of the HPPMP and its addendum in order to 
minimize environmental and climate impacts as much as possible, including by giving priority to HCFC 
production closure to achieve the HCFC reduction targets set forth in Decision XIX/6 of the Nineteenth 
Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. 
12. 
 The penalty is US$ 1.73 per kg/year of production in excess of the level required in this 
Agreement. The Country agrees that any compensated HCFC production plant that redirects any phased 
out HCFC production capacity to feedstock will be subject to the penalty to be specified in the agreement 
for each stage of the HPPMP.  
 
Stage I of the HPPMP 
 
13. 
Stage I of the HPPMP for the Country is approved in principle at a total of US $95 million to 
meet the freeze and 10 per cent reduction of the HCFC production baseline for compliance, inclusive of 
all project costs, excluding agency support costs, recognizing the Country’s need to front-load payments, 
according to the following payment schedule:  US $24 million for the 2013 tranche; US $23 million for 
the 2014 tranche; US $24 million for the 2015 tranche, and US $24 million for the 2016 tranche. The total 
funds for the 2014-2016 tranches will be released to the Country only after a verification report of prior 
year data confirming achievement of the previous production limits target has been approved by the 
Executive Committee. 
14. 
Stage I of the HPPMP will result in a sustained level of 29,122 ODP tonnes by 2013 and 10 per 
cent reduction target of 26,210 ODP tonnes by 2015 in compliance with Montreal Protocol schedules.     
15. 
The Country agrees to meet the annual production limits for the substances set out in row 1.2 
(“Maximum Allowable Production of Annex C, Group I Substances”) of Appendix 2-A (“The Targets, 
and Funding”) to this Agreement, as well as in the reduction schedule for all substances mentioned in row 
1.1 of Appendix 2-A.   
16. 
Subject to compliance by the Country with its obligations set out in this Agreement, the 
Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the funding set out in row 3.1 of Appendix 2-A 
(“The Targets, and Funding”) to the Country.  The Executive Committee will provide this funding at the 
Executive Committee meetings specified in Appendix 3-A (“Funding Approval Schedule”).  
17. 
The Country accepts that, by its acceptance of this Agreement and fulfilment by the Executive 
Committee of its funding obligations for stage I described in paragraph 16 above, it is precluded from 
applying for or receiving further funding from the Multilateral Fund in respect of any production of each 
of the substances that exceeds the levels defined in rows 4.1.3, 4.2.3, 4.3.3, 4.4.3 and 4.5.3 of 
Appendix 2-A.

Removal of activities in the annual implementation plan involving costs 
(iv)
exceeding 30 per cent of the total cost of the previous approved tranche; 
 
Reallocations not categorized as major changes may be incorporated into the 
(v)
approved annual implementation plan being implemented at that time, and 
reported to the Executive Committee in the subsequent annual implementation 
report; and 
 
Any funds remaining from Stage I of the HPPMP will be returned to the 
(vi)
Multilateral Fund upon completion of the last tranche foreseen under this 
Agreement with the understanding that the funds returned would not be deducted 
from the maximum level of funding for the overall phase-out. 
21. 
The Country will ensure that it conducts accurate monitoring of its activities under this 
Agreement.  The institutions set out in Appendix 5-A (“Monitoring Institutions and Roles”) will monitor 
and report on implementation of the activities in the previous annual implementation plans in accordance 
with their roles and responsibilities set out in Appendix 5-A.  This monitoring will also be subject to 
independent verification, as described in paragraph 19(b) above. 
22. 
The Country agrees to assume overall responsibility for the management and implementation of 
this Agreement and of all activities undertaken by it or on its behalf to fulfil the obligations under this 
Agreement.  The World Bank has agreed to be the lead implementing agency (the “Lead IA”) in respect 
of the Country’s activities under this Agreement.  The Country agrees to evaluations, which may be 
carried out under the monitoring and evaluation work programmes of the Multilateral Fund or under the 
evaluation programme of the Lead IA. 
23. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for ensuring coordinated planning, implementation and reporting 
of all activities under this Agreement, including but not limited to independent verification, as per 
paragraph 19(b) above.  The Executive Committee agrees, in principle, to provide the Lead IA with the 
fees set out in row 2.2 of Appendix 2-A. 
24. 
Should the Country, for any reason, not meet the targets for the phase-out of the substances set 
out in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A or otherwise not comply with this Agreement, the Country agrees that it 
will not be entitled to the funding in accordance with the Funding Approval Schedule.  At the discretion 
of the Executive Committee, funding will be reinstated according to a revised Funding Approval 
Schedule determined by the Executive Committee after the Country has demonstrated that it has satisfied 
all its obligations that should have been met prior to receipt of the next tranche of funding under the 
Funding Approval Schedule.   The Country acknowledges that the Executive Committee may reduce the 
amount of the funding by the amount set out in Appendix 7-A (Reductions in Funding for Failure to 
Comply for Stage I) in respect of each kg of reduction in production not achieved in any one year and, in 
respect of any redirection of phased-out HCFC production capacity to feedstock uses by compensated 
HCFC production plant, as indicated in the addendum to the HPPMP.  The Executive Committee will 
discuss each specific case in which the Country did not comply with this Agreement, and take related 
decisions. Once these decisions have been taken, this specific case will not be an impediment to receiving 
future tranches, as per paragraph 16 above. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex  XXVI

25. 
Funding under this Agreement will not be modified on the basis of any future Executive 
Committee decision that may affect the funding of any other HCFC production sector projects. 
26. 
The Country will comply with any reasonable request by the Executive Committee or the Lead 
IA to facilitate implementation of this Agreement. In particular, it will provide the Lead IA with access to 
the information necessary to verify compliance with this Agreement. 
27. 
Stage I of the reduction in production of HCFCs and the associated Agreement will be completed 
at the end of the year following the last year for which a maximum allowable total production level has 
been specified in Appendix 2-A.  At that time, should there still be outstanding activities foreseen in the 
Plan and its subsequent revisions, as per paragraphs 19(d) and 20, the completion will be delayed until the 
end of the year following the implementation of the remaining activities.  The reporting requirements as 
per sub-paragraphs 2(a), 2(b), 2(d), and 2(e) of Appendix 4-A will continue until the time of completion 
of Stage I, unless otherwise specified by the Executive Committee. 
28. 
All of the conditions set out in this Agreement are undertaken solely within the context of the 
Montreal Protocol and as specified in this Agreement.  All terms used in this Agreement have the 
meaning ascribed to them in the Montreal Protocol unless otherwise defined herein.

Committee in the year prior to the year of the work plan.   
2. 
For example, the work plan for 2014 and the progress report for the first tranche of the HPPMP 
will be submitted to the last meeting in 2013.  Funding will be transferred to the implementing agency 
upon approval of the work plan and not more than 30 per cent of this amount could be released to the 
Country before the approval of the verification report by the Executive Committee.  
3. 
A final verification report for Stage I will be submitted in 2017 to verify 2016 production. The 
last tranche of Stage I will be disbursed in full upon the approval of the 2015 verification report by the 
Executive Committee.  
 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex  XXVI

APPENDIX 4-A:  FORMAT OF IMPLEMENTATION REPORTS AND PLANS FOR STAGE I 
 
1. 
The first implementation report and plan for stage I of the HPPMP will contain an addendum that 
takes into account the final level of funding for the total phase-out, and that approved for stage I, 
including the conditions of approval in decision 69/28(e). The addendum would further define the 
conditions of approval in particular with respect to how decision 69/28(e) would be implemented.     
2. 
The submission of the implementation report and plan for each tranche request will consist of five 
parts: 
(a) 
A narrative report, with data provided by calendar year, regarding the progress since the 
year prior to the previous report, reflecting the situation of the Country in regard to 
phase-out of the substances, how the different activities contribute to it, and how they 
relate to each other in Appendix 1-A.  The report should include ODS phase-out as a 
direct result of the implementation of activities, by substance, to allow the Secretariat to 
provide the Executive Committee with information on the resulting change in climate-
relevant emissions.  It will address how the conditions of approval in decision 69/28(e) 
(paragraphs 4-12 of this Agreement) have been addressed, the actions/activities taken to 
achieve these conditions and their budgets both in the plan and the progress report. It will 
identify any redirection of phased-out production capacity, as specified in paragraph 3 of 
the Agreement that is compensated by the Agreement to production for feedstock use by 
plant and by plant line where applicable.  The report and plan will indicate what 
capacities are closed and dismantled and the target for the next year. Controlled and 
feedstock production by plant line, if applicable, should be provided. The report should 
further highlight successes, experiences, and challenges related to the different activities 
included in the plan, reflecting any changes in the circumstances in the Country, and 
providing other relevant information.  The report should also include information on and 
justification for any changes vis-à-vis the previously submitted annual implementation 
plan(s), such as delays, uses of the flexibility for reallocation of funds during 
implementation of a tranche, as provided in paragraph 20 of this Agreement, or other 
changes.  The narrative report will cover all relevant years specified in sub-
paragraph 19(a) of this Agreement and may, in addition, include information on activities 
in the current year;  
(b) 
A verification report on the results of the HPPMP and the production of the substances 
listed in Appendix 1-A, as per sub-paragraph 19(b) of this Agreement.  Unless otherwise 
decided by the Executive Committee, such a verification shall be provided together with 
each tranche request and, as specified in sub-paragraph 19(a) of this Agreement, will 
provide verification of production for all relevant years for which a verification report has 
not yet been noted by the Executive Committee; 
(c) 
A written description of the activities to be undertaken up to and including the year of the 
planned submission of the next tranche request, highlighting the interdependence of the 
activities, and taking into account experience gained and progress achieved in the 
implementation of earlier tranches; the data in the plan will be provided by calendar year.  
The description should also include a reference to the overall plan and progress achieved, 
as well as any possible changes to the overall plan that are foreseen.  The description 
should cover the years specified in sub-paragraph 19(d) of this Agreement and also 
specify and explain in detail such changes to the overall plan.  This description of future 
activities may be submitted as a part of the same document as the narrative report under 
sub-paragraph (a) above;  
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex XXVI

(d) 
A set of quantitative information for all annual implementation reports and annual 
implementation plans is to be submitted through an online database.  This quantitative 
information, to be submitted by calendar year with each tranche request, will amend the 
narratives and description for the report (in accordance with sub-paragraph (a) above) and 
the plan (in accordance with sub-paragraph (c) above), the annual implementation plan 
and any changes to the overall plan, and will cover the same time periods and activities; 
and 
(e) 
An executive summary of around five paragraphs is to be submitted in order to 
summarize the information required by sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) above.  
APPENDIX 5-A: MONITORING INSTITUTIONS AND ROLES FOR STAGE I 
 
1. 
The overall monitoring will be the responsibility of the National Ozone Unit (NOU). The 
production will be monitored based on semi-annual reports provided by HCFC producers and 
confirmation by the NOU. 
2. 
The NOU will also be responsible for reporting and shall submit the following reports in a timely 
manner: 
(a) 
Annual reports on production of each substance for controlled and feedstock uses to be 
submitted to the Ozone Secretariat; 
(b) 
Annual reports on progress in implementation of the country programme, to be submitted 
to the Executive Committee; and 
(c) 
Project-related reports to be submitted to the Lead IA. 
3. 
The Lead IA will carry out independent annual verifications at all producers for which tonnage 
was included in paragraph 3 of the Agreement for the years 2013-2016 to confirm that the HCFC 
production phase-out targets at the country level have been met. Annual HCFC production will be 
verified by following the Executive Committee’s Guidelines and Standard Format for Verification of 
ODS Production Phase-out using the Montreal Protocol’s definition of production i.e. (a) HCFC 
production is equal to the total annual HCFC production minus the total amount of HCFCs used in 
feedstock applications.  The verification reports will be submitted to the Executive Committee in 
accordance with paragraph 19 of this Agreement. 
APPENDIX 6-A: ROLE OF THE LEAD IMPLEMENTING AGENCY FOR STAGE I 
1. 
The Lead IA will be responsible for the overall supervision of the implementation of the stage I 
of the reduction in production of HCFCs under this Agreement.   The Lead IA supervision will include at 
least the following: 
(a) 
Ensuring 
performance 
and 
financial 
verification 
in 
accordance 
with 
this  
Agreement and with its specific internal procedures and requirements, as set out in the 
Country’s HPPMP and addendum;  
(b) 
Assisting the Country in preparation of the implementation plans and subsequent reports, 
as per Appendix 4-A; 
 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/71/64 
Annex  XXVI 
 
 
9 
(c) 
Providing independent verification to the Executive Committee that the targets have been 
met and associated annual activities have been completed, as indicated in the 
implementation plan consistent with Appendix 4-A; 
(d) 
Ensuring that experience and progress is reflected in updates of the overall plan and in 
future annual implementation plans, consistent with sub-paragraphs 2(c) and 2(d) of 
Appendix 4-A; 
(e) 
Fulfilling the reporting requirements for the annual implementation reports, annual 
implementation plans and the overall plans, as specified in Appendix 4-A, for submission 
to the Executive Committee; 
(f) 
Ensuring that appropriate independent technical experts carry out the technical reviews; 
(g) 
Carrying out required supervision missions; 
(h) 
Tracking implementation and use of funds to ensure that they are consistent with all the 
Lead IA policies and procedures, including safeguard policies, as well as Executive 
Committee policies and procedures and provisions of this Agreement; 
(i) 
Ensuring the presence of an operating mechanism to allow effective, transparent 
implementation of the implementation plan and accurate data reporting; 
(j) 
In case of reductions in funding for failure to comply in accordance with paragraph 1 of 
this Agreement, to determine, in consultation with the Country, the allocation of the 
reductions to the different budget items and to the agency support cost of the Lead IA; 
(k) 
Ensuring that disbursements made to the Country are based on the use of the indicators; 
and 
(l) 
Providing assistance with policy, management and technical support, when required. 
2. 
After consultation with the Country and taking into account any views expressed, the Lead IA 
will select and mandate an independent entity to carry out the verification of the results and the 
production of the substances mentioned in Appendix 1-A, as per sub-paragraph 19(b) of this Agreement 
and sub-paragraph 2(b) of Appendix 4-A.   
APPENDIX 7-A:  REDUCTIONS IN FUNDING FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY FOR STAGE I 
 
1. 
In accordance with paragraphs 12 and 24 of this Agreement, the amount of funding provided may 
be reduced by US$1.73 per kg/year of production beyond the level defined in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A 
for each year from future funding tranches in which the target specified in row 1.2 of Appendix 2-A has 
not been met.  
2. 
If any independent annual verification, as stipulated in paragraph 3 of Appendix 5-A to this 
Agreement, reveals that the phased out HCFC production capacity previously used for ODS production in 
2010, as specified in paragraph 3 of the Agreement, in any HCFC production plants that are compensated 
by this Agreement is redirected to feedstock uses in a given year, the amount of funding may be reduced 
by US$0.15 per kg/year of redirected production from future funding.

12. 
The Secretariat concluded that the request for project preparation funds for the overarching 
strategy for Turkey is in line with the guidelines contained in decision 71/42, and the additional 
requirements in decision 72/18. 
Secretariat’s recommendation 
13. 
The Fund Secretariat recommends blanket approval of the request of UNIDO for project 
preparation for stage II of the HPMP (overarching strategy) at the level of funding indicated in Table 1.  
SECTION B:  ACTIVITIES RECOMMENDED FOR INDIVIDUAL CONSIDERATION 
B1: Institutional strengthening 
(a) 
Bosnia and Herzegovina: (phase V) US $95,333 
(b) 
Libya (phase IV): US $136,065 
14. 
UNIDO submitted the requests for the renewal of the institutional strengthening (IS) projects for 
five countries listed in Table 1. The Secretariat recommended the projects for Bosnia and Herzegovina 
and for Libya for individual consideration. The description of these projects is presented in Annex I to the 
present document.  
Bosnia and Herzegovina:  Renewal of institutional strengthening project (phase V):  US $95,333 
Background 
15. 
UNIDO submitted a request for the renewal of the institutional strengthening project of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina to the 74th meeting. Bosnia and Herzegovina reported 2013 Article 7 data indicating an 
annual consumption of 5.13 ODP tonnes for Annex C group I (HCFCs) that places the country in 
potential non-compliance with a deviation of 0.4 ODP tonnes against the country’s obligation to freeze 
HCFC at the baseline level of 4.7 ODP tonnes. The situation of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be discussed 
at the 54th meeting of the Implementation Committee under the Non-Compliance Procedure (ImpCom) in 
July 2015.  
16. 
At the 72nd meeting the Executive Committee approved the second tranche of stage I of the 
HPMP for Bosnia and Herzegovina; however it applied a penalty of 10 per cent reduction in funding of 
that tranche since the 2013 HCFC consumption level was not in compliance1 with the allowable levels in 
the agreement with the Executive Committee (decision 72/30).  
Secretariat’s comments  
17. 
The Secretariat noted that in November 2013 the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
adopted the HPMP bill and an enforceable system of licensing and quotas for HCFC imports and exports 
has been in place as of January 2014.  The HCFC verification report for 2013 and the assessment of the 
HCFCs consumption trend carried out under the coordination of the NOU, and the 2014 country 
programme implementation data indicate that HCFC controls are being enforced and progress has been 
achieved in meeting the country’s Montreal Protocol obligations. UNIDO informed the Secretariat that 
Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted 2014 Article 7 data of 3.37 ODP tonnes.  
                                                      
1The non-compliance with the HPMP agreement was linked mainly to: the fact that in January 2013, the shipment of 
2,720 mt of HCFC-22 was imported against a 2012 import license; the fact that it was apparently unknown that 
stockpiling for future exports is counted as consumption in the year of import; and that substantially higher quotas 
were issued than the maximum allowable level of consumption. An additional oversight had been not to account for 
the for the HCFC-142b content of the imports of R-406A. 
UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/74/17

Secretariat’s recommendation 
18. 
In light of the information provided in the Secretariat’s comments above, including the fact that 
Bosnia and Herzegovina has already been penalized for the deviation in its 2013 HCFC consumption 
level, the positive trend indicated by the country programme implementation data for 2014, and the fact 
that the data submitted under Article 7 for 2014 is below the maximum allowable consumption, the 
Executive Committee may wish to consider approving the phase V of the IS project for Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, at the level of funding of US $95,333 plus agency support costs of US $6,673, without 
prejudice to the operation of the Montreal Protocol’s mechanism on non-compliance. 
Libya: Renewal of institutional strengthening project (phase IV):  US $136,065 
Background 
19. 
UNIDO submitted a request for the renewal of the institutional strengthening project of Libya to 
the 74th meeting.     
20. 
Libya does not have an approved HPMP partly due to the security situation and because it had not 
been possible to confirm that the country’s licensing system was fully operational. At the 73rd meeting, 
UNIDO reported that the specific legislation for the licensing and quota system in Libya is in the process 
of being signed; however, the process has been delayed due to the security situation and political changes, 
and that at the current time there is no institution belonging to central government empowered to 
issue/approve new legislation in Libya. 
Secretariat’s comments  
21. 
The Secretariat noted that the HCFC baseline for compliance for Libya at 118.38 ODP tonnes is 
based on the average of 2009 and 2010 HCFC consumption, with the latter value having been revised in 
accordance with decision XXVI/14 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The Secretariat further noted 
that Libya has reported Article 7 data indicating an annual consumption of 144 ODP tonnes for Annex C 
Group I (HCFCs) in 2013 which exceeds the HCFC baseline for the country.  The country programme 
data for 2014 indicates use of 1585.5 mt of HCFC-22 (87.21 ODP tonnes) and 320 mt of HCFC-141b 
(35.2 ODP tonnes), resulting in a total consumption of 122.41 ODP tonnes.  
22. 
During consultations with UNIDO, the Secretariat was informed that the NOU of Libya requires 
IS support to meet a number of challenges caused by the restructuring process in the country. 
Furthermore, the extension of the IS project is critical for addressing the HCFC phase-out challenge, and 
the legislative approval of Libya’s regulations to control HCFCs. Specifically, the NOU will have to 
closely follow the legal acts that have started the signatory process, and the introduction of HCFC import 
quotas (other than the licensing system). Monitoring and data collection activities regarding the annual 
consumption of HCFC by different sub-sectors are of critical importance as the sector consumption will 
define Libya’s HCFC phase-out strategy. In addition, any action plan to return to compliance will have to 
be assessed as a matter of priority by the country including consultation with the relevant stakeholders.  
Secretariat’s recommendation 
23. 
In light of the information provided in the Secretariat’s comments above, the Executive 
Committee may wish to consider approving the funding of phase IV of the IS project for Libya for one 
year only, at the level of funding of US $68,033 plus agency support costs of US $4,762, without 
prejudice to the operation of the Montreal Protocol’s mechanism on non-compliance.

training of 113 custom officers in the use of ODS identifiers was organized in April 2013 at nine border 
entry points. Article 7 data and country programme data for 2014 were submitted to the Ozone and Fund 
Secretariats, respectively on 13 April 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to be an active member of 
the Europe and Central Asia Regional Network. 
Plan of action 
3. 
In the fifth phase of the IS project the NOU is committed to further build capacity at the country 
level and enhance the ongoing regulatory efforts. The NOU will give priority to the improvement of 
HCFC controls to ensure the achievement of the 10 per cent reduction target in 2015, and will be 
responsible for tracking the promulgation and enforcement of policy and legislation for additional 
restrictions on HCFCs.  Efforts will focus on cooperation with the customs authorities in order to prevent 
illegal trade, and cooperation with the RAC association. International ozone day celebrations are planned 
and NOU staff will continue to participate in regional network and Montreal Protocol meetings.

Progress report 
5. 
The implementation of the IS activities in Libya have been delayed due to the political and 
security situations in the country. In spite of the civil war and governmental restructuring process, NOU 
technical experts in the central administration remained in charge of coordinating Montreal Protocol 
country activities and maintained basic functionality of the office with the goal of ensuring the country’s 
compliance with its Montreal Protocol obligations. The NOU supervised ODS imports/exports and 
consumption and continued to coordinate the conversion and phase-out programme in all sectors. 
Furthermore, the NOU was instrumental in the establishment of legislative and administrative measures 
by the Government to promote and accelerate the phase-out of ODS. The review of legislation for HCFC 
controls initiated during phase II of the IS project was finalized but was not officially adopted due to the 
transition period in the government. During the current phase of the IS project the country maintained 
zero consumption of methyl bromide. Furthermore, it submitted the ratification instruments for the 
Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing amendments to the Montreal Protocol to the United Nations 
depositary. 
Plan of action 
6. 
During phase IV of the IS project for Libya the NOU will follow up on the regulations for 
introducing the licensing system and quota system that are currently in the legislative approval process. 
Priority will be given to liaising with the relevant Governmental institutions in charge of clearing the 
drafts and publication into the Official Journal of Libya. The NOU will continue monitoring HCFC 
consumption by sub-sectors, the collection and submission of mandatory data to the Fund and Ozone 
Secretariats, coordination and consultation with the National Refrigeration Association. The country plans 
to implement a number of awareness and information exchange activities and to participate in regional 
network meetings.

VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON RENEWAL OF 
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING PROJECTS SUBMITTED TO THE 74th MEETING 
Bosnia and Herzegovina 
1. 
The Executive Committee reviewed the terminal report and action plan presented with the request 
for the renewal of the institutional strengthening (IS) project (phase V) submitted by Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and noted with appreciation that the country is in compliance with data reporting obligations 
to the Ozone and Fund Secretariats. The Committee further noted with appreciation the availability of 
detailed consumption data records in the HCFC verification report for 2013, the assessment of the HCFC 
consumption trend carried out by the NOU which indicated that HCFC controls have been enforced, and 
the 2014 country programme data which indicated that progress has been achieved in meeting the 
country’s Montreal Protocol obligations. The Executive Committee is pleased to note the immediate 
action taken by the national ozone unit (NOU) to ensure the country’s compliance with the Montreal 
Protocol obligation. Furthermore the Executive Committee noted that that Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 
active member of the Europe and Central Asia regional network and acknowledges the country’s 
significant contribution to the region in terms of its technical expertise and experience in regard to HCFC 
phase-out management Plan (HPMP) implementation. The Executive Committee is hopeful that, in the 
next two years the country will continue with the implementation of its HCFC phase-out plan with 
outstanding success to ensure compliance with the HCFC reduction schedule of the Montreal Protocol. 
Libya 
2. 
The Executive Committee reviewed the report presented with the request for the renewal of the IS 
project (phase IV) submitted by Libya and noted with appreciation the efforts made by the Government of 
Libya to phase-out its consumption of ODS. The Executive Committee further noted that during the 
current phase, Libya had deposited the instruments of ratification for the Copenhagen, Montreal and 
Beijing amendments to the Montreal Protocol with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The 
Executive Committee took particular note of the lack of a licensing and quota system for Libya and the 
country’s potential non-compliance with the 2013 HCFC control measure of the Montreal Protocol. 
However, the Executive Committee recognizes that the Government of Libya is making efforts to secure 
approval of the relevant legislation as demonstrated by the recent ratification of all the Montreal 
Protocol’s amendments. The Executive Committee is therefore hopeful that in the next phase, the country 
will be able to move forward with the legislation for the licensing and quota system in Libya and submit 
the HPMP for Libya for consideration by the Executive Committee in the near future. 
Oman 
3. 
The Executive Committee  reviewed the report presented with the request for the renewal of the  
IS project (phase VI)  submitted by Oman and noted with appreciation that the country reported 2014 
country programme and Article 7 data to the Fund and Ozone Secretariats, respectively, by the prescribed 
deadlines.  The Executive Committee also noted that Oman has taken steps towards HCFCs control. The 
Executive Committee supports the efforts of Oman to achieve the 10 per cent reduction target required by 
the Montreal Protocol and encourages Oman to continue to give priority to enforcing efforts to control 
HCFC consumption. The Executive Committee is pleased with the efforts and actions by Oman to 
achieve its commitments under the Montreal Protocol and is hopeful that the country will continue the 
implementation of its IS project and HCFC phase-out activities with outstanding success.

Project Summary 
 
 
NOU was maintained during the transition. The NOU is integrated in the administrative structure of the 
Environmental General Authority; it is supervised by the General Commission of the Environmental General 
Authority and it is supervised by the Director General and the Minister. 
NOU operates in coordination with other public institutions through bilateral follow up meetings, inter-
ministerial meetings and steering committees. The Libyan National Committee for Climate Change and 
Ozone Depletion includes members from Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Meteorology, National Oil 
Company, Environmental General Authority and Ministry of Agriculture. 
 
The implementation of the Institutional Strengthening Phases II and III was delayed totally 3 years due to the 
political and security situation in the country arising during the implementation. In spite of the civil war and 
governmental restructuring process, NOU technical experts in the central administration remained in charge of 
coordinating Montreal Protocol country activities, maintaining the basic functionality of the office and 
committing to ensure the country compliance with the Montreal Protocol obligations.  
  
The NOU has supervised ODS imports/exports and consumption and continued to coordinate the conversion and 
phase-out programme in all sectors covered by the Montreal Protocol. Furthermore, the NOU was instrumental in 
the establishment of legislative and administrative measures by the Government and to promote and accelerate 
the phase-out of ODSs. The legislation review with a specific view to HCFCs control was initiated during phase 
III. Sector specific public awareness programmes were developed and carried out and, through the sector-specific 
projects, training workshops were organized for manufacturing companies, farmers and customs. 
 
The NOU is further committed to build up capacity at country level in view of compliance with the HCFCs consumption 
phase-out targets and it is expected that the ongoing regulatory efforts will be further enhanced by the implementation of 
new phase of IS.  
 
The NOU will follow-up with priority the improvement of the HCFCs control, while it is expected that the country will 
achieve the 10% reduction target in 2015. 
 
IS extension Phase IV will be critical for achieving the HCFCs full control as well as for the coordination of the 
Libya HPMP. The NOU Libya will finalize the legislative review process for better HCFCs control at the level of 
end-users, by subsectors The legislative amendments were initiated under current phase and will require follow-
up during the next 2 years.

Project Summary 
 
The project is addressing further institutional strengthening and capacity building for the National 
Ozone Unit / Environmental General Authority and will ensure that the Government will meet its 
obligations under the Montreal Protocol on the substances that deplete the Ozone Layer. 
 
During phase V (year 2) the NOU will continue to monitor HCFCs consumption to maintain 
compliance with quota system and with licensing system. Quotas will be issued for the years 2018 
and 2019 to maintain HCFC consumption in line with the Agreement between the Executive 
Committee and the Executive Committee and with its commitments in decision 
XXVII/11.  Monitoring of HCFC distribution monitoring by sub-sectors will be given special 
attention as it will be critical for the successful implementation of the HCFCs phase-out policies. 
 
Libya has passed through challenges due to administrative restructuring and delays in adoption 
HCFCs specific regulatory measures to ensure full control of the country consumption. Being in 
non-compliance, the country was relaying on the institutional strengthening funding in the year 
2015, and the financial support approved for one year duration by the 74th ExCom enabled the 
country to complete its HPMP and the expedite the national legislation in the approval process. 
 
Second year of funding of the IS Phase IV is committed and activities are executed without delay. 
The HPMP Stage I is under implementation.  
 
NOU was maintained active, staff continuity was ensured during the IS Phase IV. This underlines 
the country commitment to comply with the Montreal Protocol obligations. 
 
The National Ozone Unit is responsible for and oversees the implementation of the HPMP project 
and ensures the further phase-out of the annual HCFCs consumption. It has a major role in the 
process of monitoring of the project activities.   
 
 
 
The NOU actively cooperate with ministries and inter-ministerial bodies as well as with advisory 
groups such as customs authorities, refrigeration sector representatives, NGOs and others

Describe the role and position of the National Ozone Unit (NOU) within the national administration, the 
way its work is supervised and its access to senior decision-makers (this may include cooperation with 
steering committees, advisory group or inter-ministerial bodies).  
 
In spite of the political instability, administrative changes and the security situation, NOU was maintained active, 
staff continuity was ensured and there are no major administrative changes affecting functionality of NOU. The 
country has achieved endorsement of the HPMP plan and returned to compliance with a view to implementation of 
 
2
a licensing system controlling the HCFCs consumption. 
 
The NOU is integrated in the administrative structure of the Environmental General Authority and it is actively 
building its technical and managerial capacity; the NOU planning and national policies are supervised by the 
General Commission of the Environmental General Authority and its daily activity is coordinated and supervised by 
the Director General and the Minister. 
 
The only administrative change is appointment of a new Ozone Unit Manager in April 2018, that reported to

Assessment of the 2016 
annual consumption and 
its distribution by sub-
sector 
 
  
NOU is conducting data 
collection as a daily 
activity, by liaising with 
stakeholders in the country 
(importers, exporters, end-
users) 
 
 
 
 
The consumption 
distribution by subsectors 
was assessed as a key 
element of the HPMP 
document (submitted and 
approved at the first 
ExCom meeting in 2016) 
 
The data were correlated 
with the additional data on 
ODS alternatives collected 
under the ODS alternatives 
survey. 
 
An inventory of the 
quantities and qualities of 
the imported refrigerants 
estimated as contained in 
equipment, for the 
assessment of the 
refrigerant servicing needs 
based on installed 
capacities in Libya has 
been also achieved 
through the results of the 
ODS alternatives survey 
 
 
The NOU will 
continue to monitor 
the HCFCs 
consumption 
distribution by 
subsectors and will 
ensure data cross 
check with relevant 
stakeholders  
 
The NOU will 
initiate further 
collection on HFCs 
data for future 
compliance with the 
Kigali Amendment 
HCFCs 
consumption data

not adopted and published 
into the Official Journal 
and it did not enter into 
force.  
Legislation 
amendments are 
requiring follow up 
by NOU team, for 
their adoption. 
 
Priority will be 
given in liaising 
with relevant 
Governmental 
institutions in 
charge of clearing 
the drafts for their 
considerations and

Action Plan  
 
During phase V the NOU will continue to monitor HCFCs consumption to maintain compliance with quota 
system and with licensing system. Quotas will be issued for the years 2018 and 2019 to maintain HCFC 
consumption in line with the Agreement between the Executive Committee and the Executive Committee 
and with its commitments in decision XXVII/11.  Monitoring of HCFC distribution monitoring by sub-
sectors will be given special attention as it will be critical for the successful implementation of the HCFCs 
phase-out policies.

The project is addressing further institutional strengthening and capacity building for the National 
Ozone Unit/ Environmental General Authority and will ensure that the Government will meet its 
obligations under the Montreal Protocol on the substances that deplete the Ozone Layer.   
 
In this context, the role and functions of the National Ozone Unit (NOU) established within the 
Environmental General Authority of Libya in the past two years remained unchanged. 
 
During phase V, the Libyan NOU was fully staffed. Significant efforts were made, given the 
country political and security situation, to continue with the implementation of the Montreal 
Protocol activities. Quotas for the period 2018 – 2020 were established and are being monitored 
on regular basis. The country consumption is below the control limits. The NOU continued to 
maintain cooperation with other public institutions through regular bilateral meetings, inter-
ministerial meetings and steering committees. Country programme data and Article 7 data reports 
for 2017 and 2018 were submitted. Ozone Day Celebrations were organized in 2018 and 2019. 
Libyan officials attended the Meetings of the Party and Open-ended Working Group meetings in 
the reporting period. 
 
During phase VI the NOU will continue to monitor HCFCs consumption to maintain compliance 
with quota system and with licensing system. Quotas will be issued for the years 2021 and 2022 
to maintain HCFC consumption in line with the Agreement between the Executive Committee and 
the Executive Committee and with its commitments in decision XXVII/11.  Activities planned 
under the next phase include: CP and Article 7 data reporting; continued monitoring the licensing 
system and allocate quotas to achieve full control over the imports of all HCFCs; continuing 
making efforts to introduce a ban importing or manufacturing HCFC equipment; continue 
cooperation with custom authorities and industry representatives; facilitate the ratification process 
of the Kigali Amendment through implementation of the enabling activities project. Public 
awareness activities will include celebration of international ozone day and the country plans to
