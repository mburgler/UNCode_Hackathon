BACKGROUND DESIGN ANALYSIS
Baseline scenario:
China was an early mover in advocating a circular economy policy. China's Circular Economy Promotion Law 
came into force in January 2009 (the word "circular" in the title is essentially synonymous with 'sustainable'). The 
Law is formulated for the purpose of facilitating circular economy, raising resources utilization rate, protecting and 
improving environment and realizing sustained development. 
 
The Circular Economy is the general term for the activities of decrement, recycling and resource recovery in 
production, circulation and consumption: 
 
- Decrement in this context means the reduction of the resource consumption and waste generation in 
production, circulation and consumption; 
- Recycling means the direct use of wastes as products, or the use of wastes as products after repair, renovation 
or reproduction of them, or the use of wastes, wholly or partly, as parts of other products; 
- Resource recovery means the direct use of wastes as raw material, or waste regeneration. 
 
Although the circular economy concept has been incorporated as policy in the national law, and a wide range of 
local laws in the form of regulations, decisions, orders and quality standards have been issued to support the 
national law, the approaches taken by the national and local governments and the private sector toward the 
circular economy lack an overarching anchor and systematic guidelines. Currently, programmes under the

patronage of the circular economy aim to improve, but not change, the current industrial economic model and the 
associated mindset by typically targeting resource savings and waste reduction. These programmes are 
inherently self-limiting and therefore cannot achieve a thorough circular economy, because even if all refining 
and improvements are made, there will still be environmental inefficiencies which cannot be addressed. 
 
There is clearly a need for paradigm shifts, a need to upgrade the understandings of a circular economy in China 
and its associated approaches. One of the internationally accepted paradigm that can contribute to the 
achievement of a thorough circular economy is the Eco-effectiveness concept. 
 
 
 
In 2014, the EU Commission initiated an enabling framework for a circular economy that “designs out” waste in a 
process that involves innovative reimagining of the whole value chain rather than relying solely on solutions at 
the end of life of a product. Such a framework places the principles of eco-effectiveness at the centre of powering 
Europe’s circular economy. 
 
Eco-effectiveness suggests that industry must protect and enrich ecosystems and nature's biological metabolism 
while also maintaining a safe, productive technical metabolism for the high-quality use and circulation of organic 
and technical nutrients. It is a holistic economic, industrial and social framework that seeks to create systems that 
are not only efficient but also essentially waste free. The model is primarily applied in industrial design and 
manufacturing, but in its broadest sense can also be applied to many aspects of human civilization such as urban 
environment, buildings, economics and social systems. 
 
 
The transformative process of reimaging and rethinking total value chains is labeled variously as Eco-effective 
Management or ‘Cradle to Cradle’, a commercial copyrighted brand registered by William Mac Donough[1]. 
 
At the forefront of this transformative process is the application of eco-effectiveness principles to industry design, 
which requires the design of products and systems to be a biomimetic approach that models industry on nature's 
processes and views materials as nutrients circulating in healthy, safe metabolisms. This renders a shift of 
emphasis to upstream industrial design, which means designing products and systems with special 
considerations for the environmental impacts during the whole life cycle.  
 
Eco-effectiveness industrial design advocates sustainability in the use, reuse and continuous flows of materials 
within and throughout the industrial life cycle without downgrading the materials. It demands a no-waste 
philosophy in the very beginning of design of an industrial product, production system and service which looks to 
the continuous reuse of materials and the nurturing of the supporting eco-system. 
 
 
 
It is noteworthy to mention that the notion of “industrial design” here is used in its broad sense. Contrary to the 
traditional understanding of the notion, which emphasizes the process of design applied to industrial products 
only, industrial design in a broad sense is “a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds 
business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and 
experiences”, and “at its heart, industrial design links innovation, technology, research, business and customers 
to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social and environmental spheres.”[2] 
 
 
As such, applying eco-effectiveness principles to industrial design which takes a holistic approach and employs 
innovative and future-proof technologies and concepts is vital to achieving economic, environmental and social 
sustainability, and therefore inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID) in a country. 
 
 
This transformative paradigm has been embraced in many parts of the European Union with illustrative examples 
where municipalities have taken the lead to create the enabling environment for the reimaging of urban design, 
living environment, public services and utilities, construction, industrial design of products and processes, 
materials sourcing, manufacturing, logistics, distribution and consumption. The City of Venlo (The Netherland), 
the cities of Bielefeld (Germany) and Emscher-Lippe (Germany) and the country of Luxembourg are among 
many pioneering examples. A prime example of eco-effectiveness design in an urban setting is the Venlo City 
Hall, a building that was designed and built using recovered material. The building is considered to be a “material 
bank”, which enables the conservation of materials within the construct so that they create continuous life cycles 
after the demolition of this building, and it uses passive heating, lighting and air purification, all of which 
contribute to a comfortable and healthy working environment combined with innovative sustainability and added 
value. 
 
China has recently established two designated urban areas where new and innovative paths to sustainable 
urban environments coupled with clusters of high-tech green industries and innovative businesses will be

explored and developed. These two designated areas are Xiong’an New Area in Hebei Province and Liangzhu 
New Town in Zhejiang Province. 
 
Xiong’an New Area is situated 100 km southwest of Beijing. On April 1, 2017, China announced its decision to 
establish Xiong'an New Area. This is a new area of national significance after the Shenzhen Special Economic 
Zone and the Shanghai Pudong New Area. According to the announced national strategy, it will focus on building 
clusters of high-tech and innovative businesses and take over some "non-capital functions" from Beijing. The 
New Area will explore the path for sustainable urban development and strengthen the economic competitiveness 
for China. The top priority for Xiongan's smooth start lies in sound environmental protection and early scientific 
planning and regulation.[3] During his February visit, President Xi Jinping called for "world vision, international 
standards, Chinese characteristics and high goals" in planning and construction of the New Area. The 
establishment of Xiong'an New Area is a key move to boost the coordinated development of the Beijing, Tianjin 
and Hebei region. This move is a national event and a crucial strategy for the coming millennium. The project will 
therefore seize the opportunity and the special moment in which the planning of Xiong’an, including of 
environment protection, social and economic development and industry layout is still under way, and contribute 
to the building of an innovative mind-set of governmental stakeholders who are responsible for the development 
of this New Area. 
 
 
Liangzhu New Town is situated north-east of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province. The area has been a pioneer of 
new town construction in China in the 2000s. The experimental venture provides a well-balanced system of 
social, environmental, and lifestyle accommodations. That spirit of experimental venturing and openness to new 
thinking persists in Liangzhu New Town. In 2016, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology 
(MIIT) and the Zhejiang provincial government signed a strategic cooperation agreement on the promotion of 
industrial design in the province. With that, China's first industrial design innovation base was settled in Liangzhu 
to promote an innovation-driven industrial design development strategy in China. The overarching cooperation 
agreement aims to help push forward the "Made in China 2025 Action Plan", and accelerate the development of 
technological innovation, product innovation, format innovation and business model innovation, focusing on 
intelligent manufacturing, collaborative manufacturing, green manufacturing. In December 2016, the first World 
Industrial Design Conference was held in Liangzhu, which brought together organizations and enterprises in the 
field of industry design from 26 countries. Considering the strategic nature of the Liangzhu New Town as an 
global industrial design platform, the project aiming to promote the eco-effectiveness concept in industrial design 
will not only help change the mind-set of national stakeholders involved in industrial design, but also have a spill-
over effect to international stakeholders. 
 
 
From UNIDO’s perspective the opportunity presented by the national initiatives in Xiong’an and Liangzhu to 
promote eco-effectiveness strategic thinking in terms of industrial design is consistent with the organization’s 
mandate of facilitating inclusive and sustainable industrial development [ISID]. 
 
Therefore UNIDO, in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of China, and in 
partnership with eco-effectiveness pioneering cities and regions in Europe (in particular Venlo in the 
Netherlands), will promote eco-effectiveness principles in industrial design in China through demonstration in two 
pilot areas, namely Xiong’an New Area in Hebei province and Liangzhu New Town in Zhejiang province. 
 
In particular, the project will focus on 1) incorporating eco-effectiveness principles in municipality policies and 
incentives to create an enabling environment to foster sustainable urban design, construction and management; 
2) creating a supportive environment for eco-effectiveness industries and services; and 3) developing and 
demonstrating live case studies where eco-effectiveness principles are applied to municipal design and services 
delivery as well to industry and service value chains in the two pilot areas.

CUMMULATIVE SUMMARY ### Summary

The document outlines a project initiated by UNIDO in collaboration with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, focusing on applying eco-effectiveness principles to industrial design in two pilot areas in China. The project, valued at EUR 609,027 with an additional EUR 20,000 requested for preparatory assistance, aims to promote sustainable urban design and industrial practices across the nation, contributing to China's circular economy efforts.

China, having established a circular economy policy since 2009, faces challenges in creating a cohesive, systematic approach toward sustainability. The project seeks to address these issues by fostering a shift towards eco-effectiveness—where industrial processes mimic natural systems, emphasizing resource preservation and waste elimination.

The EU, particularly through examples like the City of Venlo, provides a model for this transition, showcasing successful integration of eco-effectiveness in urban and industrial design. Similarly, China's Xiong’an New Area and Liangzhu New Town have been identified as prime locations for implementing innovative, sustainable design practices, serving as models for broader national and international application.

Key components of the project involve raising awareness and understanding of eco-effectiveness among policymakers and planners, integrating these principles into local policies and industry practices, and promoting collaboration between Chinese cities and European counterparts experienced in eco-effective design.

The project is organized into specific outputs and activities targeted at achieving these goals by February 2021, with funding expected from UNIDO, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, and potential co-financing efforts.

Title: Contribution to eco-design in China
Country: CN
Description: The purpose of the project is to promote the eco-design concepts in the field of industrial design in China, thereby contributing to the achievement of ISID, and the Circular Economy in China.
Circular economy is based on the principle that industrial systems must create no waste and pollution, and maintain use and circulation of biological and technical nutrients at their highest possible value for as long as possible. Eco-design, a critical life stage of a product in a value chain, promotes sustainability, enables continuous reuse of products, components, and parts as well as materials. The implementation of eco-design principles and practices is vital to the application of circular economy practices.
The project will achieve its objective by four outputs including:  1) Awareness of eco-design concepts and practices raised among government officials and the private sector; 2) Action plans on eco-design developed in selected industrial value chains in pilot cities; 3) Partnership between governments and enterprises in pilot Chinese cities and pioneering European cities forged or strengthened; 4) Support provided to the set-up of policy incentive schemes and formulation of eco-design standards in selected industrial value chains.

CIETC/MIIT initially identified pilot sites as Nanhai District of Foshan City in Guangdong province Wujin Green Building Industry Cluster Demonstration Zone of Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province, and Huzhou in Zhejiang province. Of these, CIETC/MIIT, proposed to start with two value chains in this phase of the project: textile and textile machinery in Foshan City, and green buildings in Changzhou City.  The project is open to expand its scope to include other pilot cities whose industrial value chains have strategic relevance in phase 2, subject to availability of resources. This project’s duration is 36 months.

SUMMARY:  ### Summary

The document outlines a project initiated by UNIDO in collaboration with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, focusing on applying eco-effectiveness principles to industrial design in two pilot areas in China. The project, valued at EUR 609,027 with an additional EUR 20,000 requested for preparatory assistance, aims to promote sustainable urban design and industrial practices across the nation, contributing to China's circular economy efforts.

China, having established a circular economy policy since 2009, faces challenges in creating a cohesive, systematic approach toward sustainability. The project seeks to address these issues by fostering a shift towards eco-effectiveness—where industrial processes mimic natural systems, emphasizing resource preservation and waste elimination.

The EU, particularly through examples like the City of Venlo, provides a model for this transition, showcasing successful integration of eco-effectiveness in urban and industrial design. Similarly, China's Xiong’an New Area and Liangzhu New Town have been identified as prime locations for implementing innovative, sustainable design practices, serving as models for broader national and international application.

Key components of the project involve raising awareness and understanding of eco-effectiveness among policymakers and planners, integrating these principles into local policies and industry practices, and promoting collaboration between Chinese cities and European counterparts experienced in eco-effective design.

The project is organized into specific outputs and activities targeted at achieving these goals by February 2021, with funding expected from UNIDO, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, and potential co-financing efforts.
