    "project_description": "**Integrated Summary:**\n\n**Recap:** The project is a national action plan aimed at managing mercury in the artisanal and small-scale gold mining sector in Rwanda, focusing on reducing mercury use, developing a National Action Plan, and improving health awareness. Key stakeholders include UNIDO, UNITAR, Rwanda Environment Management Agency, and relevant government ministries, with a strong emphasis on gender equality and capacity building.\n\n**New Developments:**\n1. **Institutional Capacity Assessment:** Various activities, such as consulting stakeholders, identifying gaps, and conducting health assessments, are outlined. The rapid health situation assessment aims to draft a public health strategy for the ASGM sector.\n   \n2. **National Action Plan Drafting:** The NAP drafting process involves stakeholder consultations, finalization, and presentation for feedback. The plan aims to address mercury management in ASGM, considering gender vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Mercury Inventory Analysis:** A Mercury Initial Assessment will establish baseline information on mercury use, emissions, and practices in the ASGM sector. This data will guide the NAP development and increase understanding of sector practices.\n\n4. **Cost-Effectiveness Consideration:** The project's cost effectiveness is ensured through utilizing GEF resources to minimize mercury use in ASGM, increase awareness, and build local capacity, thereby reducing costs associated with consultancy and travel.\n\n**Contextual Contribution:**\nThese new details enhance the project's overarching theme of reducing pollutants in the ASGM sector and align with the focus area of Circularity, Waste, and Pollutants Reduction. The emphasis on capacity building, stakeholder engagement, and gender considerations continues to support Sustainable Development Goals like SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).\n\n**Priority:** Sustainable Supply Chains  \n**Focus Area of Expertise:** Circularity, Waste, and Pollutants Reduction  \n**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**  \n1. SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being  \n2. SDG 5: Gender Equality  \n3. SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production  ",
