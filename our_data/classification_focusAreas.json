This includes assisting countries in developing strategies to comply with environmental agreements and fostering innovation ecosystems that catalyze new industries focused on reducing the environmental footprint of industrial activities. Circularity can be improved by promoting the reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling of products and materials to close the loop of material flows within the economy. This more sustainable and regenerative system ensures that resources are kept in use for as long as possible to minimize waste generation. By reducing waste and pollutants being released into the environment, societies can mitigate environmental degradation, protect human health, and conserve natural resources for future generations."
