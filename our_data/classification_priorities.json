            "description": "Climate action refers to efforts aimed at mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. It involves taking proactive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening resilience, transitioning towards renewable energy sources, and implementing policies to limit global warming including the reduction of ozone depleting substances (ODS) such as Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) and Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). Ultimately, climate action aims to minimize environmental degradation, and promoting conservation. Companies have the potential to become leading providers of technological solutions, business models and green jobs to influence consumer behavior and lifestyles to mitigate climate change and resource depletion."

            "description": "Sustainable supply chains are systems of production and distribution that prioritize environmental, social, and economic responsibility throughout the entire process. This approach considers the impacts of sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, and consumption on people and the planet. It involves minimizing carbon emissions, reducing waste, conserving resources, and ensuring fair labor practices along. Sustainable supply chains prioritize ethical sourcing of materials, support local economies, and promote transparency and accountability among suppliers.
